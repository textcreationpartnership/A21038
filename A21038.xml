            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Repentance then neuer beeing vnſeaſonable, ſurely not now; when God, what by our ſinnes, what by his iudgements, <hi>calleth vnto weeping and mourning, vnto baldneſſe and girding with ſacke-cloath.</hi>

Wherfore for our more happy direction in it, let vs firſt ſee what it is. Now I thinke it may not amiſſe thus be deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>Repentance is a ſupernaturall grace of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying ſpirit, wherby a beleeuing ſinner ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelfe for ſinne, that hee turnes from it to the Lord.</p>

So alſo that phraſe of giuing Repentance <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. and 11. 18. for if God giue it, we receiue it. Now wee cannot properly be ſayd to receiue an action which wee doe, but the power, gift, or grace whereby we do it. That ſpeech alſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 8.

                     <p>This ſhewes that Repentance is not a Legall, but an Euangelicall grace.

As for the Law, it being the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of death. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. how can it worke Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which is vnto life? 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18. Repentance is required vnto the ſenſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and forgiueneſſe. The Law then knowing no forgiueneſſe, neither knowes it any Repentance. When the Law is broken, it requires the ſuffering of the curſe, and not any Repentance for the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the curſe. It ſends vs down to the dungeon of damnation, and ſeales it vpon vs with an vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable ſtone, not giuing vs the leaſt inckling of any recouery. Nay the Law ſetting out vnto vs that moſt rigorous and preciſe Iuſtice of God, and his infinite, and implacable wrath againſt ſin, doth in a manner forbid all Repentance. Telling vs tis in vaine to ſeeke by our teares and lamentations any mercy at his hands, who is a conſuming fire, a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:197:6"/> God of pure eyes, and cannot behold iniquity. The Law then of it ſelfe leaues a man in vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, then which what can be more contrary to ſauing Repentance? and is no otherwiſe a ſchoole-maſter vnto Chriſt, then as the miniſter of the Goſpell makes vſe of it contrary to it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to driue vs vnto Chriſt, by ſhewing the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner condemned in the Law, that it were not beſt for him to truſt any longer to the Law, but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the grace offered in the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>The Vſe. 1. If Repentance be a part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, then know we it is not ſo ſowre and crabbed a thing as moſt thinke. Indeed the Law is pure vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger. But the Goſpell is refreſhing and ſuppling oyle, euen the ſoueraigne balme of Gilead, and of this Goſpell, the glad tidings of peace, is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance a part. Yea, it is one of the legacies of the new Teſtament. A rich treaſure purchaſed with the bloud of Chriſt. <hi>Luc.</hi> 24. 46. 47. Sorrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is bitter and vnpleaſant to our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet many things are wholſome, that are not ſo toothſome. The ſheepe of Chriſt know that to feed vpon this ſalt marſh is the onely preſeruatiue againſt the rot. Therefore nothing is there they leſſe repent themſelues of, then this Repentance, nothing they reioyce more in, then this ſorrow: and good reaſon. It is a peece of that bleſſed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the difficulty of Repentance diſcourage thee, remember that the commandements of the Goſpell haue grace annexed; by reaſon the ſame things that are commanded in the Goſpell are alſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:197:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> promiſed: and ſo this yoake is ſweet and eaſie.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the weakneſſe of thy Repentance trouble thee, remember it is an Euangelicall grace: and how little a mite will the Goſpell accept? euen a penny for a pound. A deſire to repent is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance heere: and to grieue becauſe wee cannot bee grieued, goes currant for godly ſorrow.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the deſcription I adde further, that it is a <note place="margin">Wrought by the Spirit, euen</note> grace of the ſpirit, to ſhew that the Spirit is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour thereof, as appeareth, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>I will powre the ſpirit of grace vpon the houſe of Iudah, and then they ſhall lament.</hi> Before we can powre out one teare into Gods bottle, God muſt powre the water of his ſpirit vpon the dry and heathy ground of our hearts. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. Wee cannot breath out ſo much as a ſigh, but the ſpirit muſt firſt breath it in. We cannot <hi>ſuſpirare,</hi> vnleſſe God doe firſt <hi>inſpirare.</hi> That we may truely ſay heere with <hi>Dauid,</hi> in euery repenting ſigh, ſob, teare, <hi>Of thine owne, Lord haue we giuen thee.</hi> Wee powre out, becauſe thou haſt firſt powred in. <hi>Peter</hi> weepes, but firſt Chriſt loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on him. The waters flow, but then ſpecially when the winde blowes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 18. Oh to how low an ebbe will the waters of repenting teares come, if this bleſſed winde of the Spirit blow not? It is the fire of the Spirit in our hearts (like as in a Still) that ſendeth vp thoſe dewes of repenting teares into our heads, that droppe foorth of our eyes.</p>

But withall I cal this ſinner, a beleeuing ſinner, to ſhew that faith muſt goe before Repentance as the ground and root thereof. In time Faith and Repentance are both together, but in the order of nature, faith is firſt.</p>
                     <p>Reaſons. 1. Repentance and griefe for diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God by ſinne neceſſarily argue the loue of God: for a man would neuer grieue but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce at the offence of him whom he hates. When Chriſt wept for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the Iewes ſayd, <hi>Loe how he loued him. Ioh.</hi> 11. and Chriſt imputes the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting teares of that ſinnefull woman <hi>Luc.</hi> 7. to loue; <hi>Much is forgiuen her, for ſhe loued much.</hi> And wheras <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21. <hi>Paul</hi> makes Faith and Repentance the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:197:8"/> ſumme of the Goſpell, the ſame Apoſtle 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. makes faith and loue the ſumme of it: which ſhewes plainely that Repentance comes from loue, and ſo conſequently from faith, becauſe <hi>faith works by loue, Gal.</hi> 5. 6. and it is impoſſible wee ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loue God, till by faith wee know our ſelues lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God. 2. Repentance beeing vnto life muſt needes bee drawen out of Chriſt the fountaine of all ſpirituall life, and quickning grace. So that a man muſt firſt receiue Chriſt before he can receiue Repentance, or any grace from Chriſt. Now faith is that which receiues Chriſt: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. 3. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance being the ſoftning of our hearts, and the changing of our natures, how ſhall our ſtony harts bee molten, but in Chriſts bloud? and what can bathe them in that blood, but faith? And how ſhall ſuch wilde oliue branches as wee be changed, but by being engrafted into Chriſt as into the naturall Oliue? And what can ingraft vs into him, but faith? 4. It is impoſſible that a man apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nothing in God but rigour and ſeuerity, ſhould euer relent toward him, or come in and ſubmit himſelfe. No, <hi>there is mercy with thee ô Lord that thou mighteſt be feared, Pſal.</hi> 130. This is it that brings in the ſinner creeping and crouching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; as the <hi>Syrians</hi> to <hi>Ahab,</hi> becauſe they had heard <hi>the Kings of Iſrael were mercifull.</hi> Chriſts <note place="margin">1.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:197:9"/> of God in the Goſpell, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>O yee diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent children returne,</hi> for I am your Lord. So <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. <hi>Repent for the Kingdome of Heauen is at hand,</hi> in which Chriſt is ready to diſpenſe mercy and forgiueneſſe to the repenting ſinner: ſo <hi>Oſ.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. There muſt be faith then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend at leaſt ſome hope &amp; poſſibility of mercy, or elſe the ſinner will harden his heart, and enrage his affections, &amp; grow furiouſly deſperate againſt the Lord. 5. As the legall Repentance cannot be without Faith, beleeuing the threats of the Law, ſo neither by like proportion can the Euangelicall Repentance bee without faith in the promiſes of the Goſpell going before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob. Mar.</hi> 1. 15. Repent, and beleeue. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is ſet firſt: and ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The order of placing things in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not alwayes according to the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But ſometimes one thing is ſet firſt, which in order of nature is laſt, as the effect before the cauſe, and then the cauſe comes after, to ſhew how wee ſhould obtaine the effect. As faith is ſet after a good conſcience and pure heart, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. when yet it is faith that purifieth the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. So heere: firſt repent, and then, that yee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, beleeue.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Things in Scripture are often propounded according to the order of our ſenſe and feeling. Now though faith in order of nature be firſt, and the act of Faith before the Act of Repentance, yet it is not ſo liuely and ſtrong, and ſo, not ſo ſenſible to vs till after Repentance: for the promiſes are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:197:9"/> made onely to repenting ſinners.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob. Matth.</hi> 21. 32. Yee repented not that yee might beleeue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sometimes then name of Repentance is giuen to the firſt preparatory beginnings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductions thereof. Now the preparations to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are thoſe legall fits of feare and terrour which are both in nature and time to, before Faith.</p>
                     <p>The Vſe. 1. Againſt the Popiſh Repentance, which is made to goe before mercy and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as a meritorious procurer thereof. But as we haue ſeene Repentance is cauſed by the taſte of Gods mercy by faith. Therefore the Baptiſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth to repentance, not that the Kingdome of Heauen may come, as earned out by the ſweat of pennance, but becauſe the Kingdome of Heauen is come. Againe, there cannot poſſibly bee any true repentance in Popery: becauſe repentance ſpringeth from the particular apprehenſion of Gods mercy by faith, which Popery cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Againſt the Libertines abuſing Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and eaſineſſe to forgiue, vnto wantonneſſe. As the grace that Kings vſe to ſhew againſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments makes many theeues. But indeed they are beaſts, and no men that ſin becauſe of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and it is an argument that they neuer by Faith taſted of Gods mercy in the pardon of their owne ſinnes. For they that feele much forgiueneſſe, loue much <hi>Luc.</hi> 7. If a man ſhould tell a condemned Traytour that his Soueraigne would forgiue all his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:197:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> treaſons, and reſtore him to all his former digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, would not ſuch mercy make his heart euen to melt, and knit him faſter in loue, and duety then euer?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Heere is comfort to all true Repentants that mourne for their ſinnes, and purpoſe a new courſe. This repentance of theirs is an euident argument of their faith that hath taſted of the ſweetneſſe of Gods mercy, or elſe their hearts would neuer thus yeeld, nor relent toward God.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is further added, <hi>ſo humbleth himſelfe for</hi>

                        <hi>Ob.</hi> One part is not a cauſe of his fellow-part. But ſorrow is a cauſe of the change of mind, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. Therefore ſorrow and change of minde are not fellow-parts of Repentance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> One part may bee a cauſe of his fellow-part. As ſanctification of the ſoule is the cauſe of the ſanctification of the body. And yet both are parts of ſanctification.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> Contrition ſeems to be a part of the change and alteration. For what greater change then for a hard heart to turne ſoft, and a ſtony to become fleſhie. And this is contrition or humiliation. Therefore Humiliation and Alteration are not well diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle plainely diſtinguiſheth them, when he ſaith, <hi>Godly ſorrow cauſeth Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> that is the change of minde. For though godly ſorrow bee a part and peece of that paſſiue change which is wrought in vs at the firſt inſtant of our calling by God, yet it is a cauſe of the actiue change, whereby we change and alter the purpoſe and reſolution of our harts before ſet on ſinne, and now turne them to the Lord. For were it not that we felt the bitterneſſe of our ſinnes, and were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched in conſcience for them, wee would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in good ſadneſſe forſake, and abrenounce them.</p>
                     <p>Howſoeuer then ſome late Diuines take the word Repentance more reſtrainedly, ſome onely for a godly ſorrow, others only for a turning from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:197:12"/> ſinne to the Lord, yet the truth is, that Repentance accordingly as it is deſcribed in the Scripture is the connexion of them both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> Heere then is the triall of our Repentance. If humiliation and Reformation both meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then is our Repentance accompliſhed. But either of theſe ſingle make but a halfe, and a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting repentance. An <hi>vnreformed</hi> ſorrow is but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi> And a <hi>ſorrowleſſe</hi> reformation is but a very <hi>ſorry</hi> one. Humiliation without reformation, is a foundation without a building. And reformation without humiliation is a building without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. To lay a foundation, and not to build on it, is to no purpoſe, but to expoſe our ſelues to laughter. <hi>Luc.</hi> 14. <hi>This man began: but could not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</hi> To build without a foundation is to play the fooliſh builder, <hi>Luc.</hi> 6. 48. for that building will ſoone fall, and ſo all our labour will be loſt. Heere then is diſcouered a double errour in repentance.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Of ſuch hypocrites as make much adoe, and ſeem to lay their ſins much to heart, &amp; yet ſtil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in them, bathing &amp; cheriſhing, not drowning &amp; choaking them in their tears. Such a one was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab;</hi> who crept &amp; crouched, &amp; put on ſackcloath, being threatned for his cruelty againſt <hi>Naboth.</hi> But without any true reformation, for preſently after he fell to as bad cruelty againſt the holy Prophet <hi>Micaiah Iudas</hi> was grieued for murthering Chriſt; yet no change enſued: hee fell to murthering of himſelfe. The Iſraelites being threatned by God when as they meditated a returne into Aegypt, wept and howled. And yet at the ſame time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:197:12"/> commanded not to goe the next way to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> but to fetch a compaſſe about, they diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But theſe men ſorrow not aright, becauſe they ſorrow not as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did vnto a <hi>tranſmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> vnto a change of their thoughts and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from euill to good. It is not poſſible a man ſhould truely grieue, and be diſpleaſed for his ſins, and yet continue in them without a change. For as one very well ſayes, <hi>vnleſſe ſinne be made a wanton it will not ſtay.</hi> It likes no grimme entertainement. The ſad countenance, the weeping eyes, the frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forehead daſh it quite out of countenance. It is not able to ſtand before them. The teares of true Repentance haue a purging and a raiſing vertue: &amp; therfore the Prophet exhorting to Repentance, ſayes, <hi>Waſh yee, make yee cleane.</hi> Theſe teares there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Iſ. 1. 16.</note> are waſhing and cleanſing teares; where they fall they make cleane worke, ſcouring away the filthineſſe of our ſinnes. The abundance of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall raine maketh the waies fowle that before were faire. But contrarily the more abundantly this raine falleth, the cleaner and fairer are the wayes of our hearts, and fitter for the feet of the Lord to walke in. For this is that ſame <hi>preparing of the way</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>of the Lord,</hi> which the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> requires. Worldly ſorrow workes a change in the body; it brings gray haires on the head, and furrowes and wrinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles in the face. It turnes youth into olde age, and ſtrength into weakneſſe, and ſo cauſeth death. But the change of godly ſorrow is quite contrary: It turnes olde age into youth, and a weakneſſe and ſickneſſe into health and ſtrength. No diſtillations
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:197:13"/> of waters heale our bodily diſeaſes ſo, as this water doth our ſpirituall. This ſalt brine takes away all our raw humours, and makes vs ſauory meate for the Lord. This raine diſſolues the clowds of our iniquities, and ô what a pure cleereneſſe is there in the heauen of our hearts? And therfore iuſtly may wee ſuſpect their repentance, whoſe ſorrow brings not with it this happy change.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. So alſo may we theirs, whoſe change and alteration proceedes not from godly ſorrow, and touch of conſcience for ſinne. Let it not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vs that in many things wee haue reformed our wayes. For ſo did <hi>Herod, Iudas,</hi> and many other temporary beleeuers. But alas this reformation was not grounded vpon true humiliation, and ſo at length it came to nought, as an vnfounded buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And therefore by humiliation firſt digge wee deepe in our hearts, and caſt out the rotten and vnſound ground, and ſo build wee. Excellent is the counſell of Chriſt to luke-warme <hi>Laodicea, be zealous,</hi> that is, reforme the fault of thy luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <note place="margin">Reuel. 3.</note> but withall he addes, and <hi>Repent,</hi> namely, of thy lukewarmneſſe, let the reformation of thy fault be grounded on ſound ſorrow for it. So may I ſay to the couetous, be liberall, and repent; to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, be chaſte, and repent; to the neglecter of Gods worſhip, frequent the Church and exerciſes of Religion, and repent. Many Profeſſours haue made a goodly flouriſh, and of couetous haue tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned liberall, and of prophane deuout, and who ſo forward as they? But when they turned religious they did not heartily repent, and repine at their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:197:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> former prophaneſſe, grieuing and grudging at the ſeruice which formerly they did Sathan. They ſowed not the ſeed of their obedience in tears, nay with the ſtony ground they beganne in ioy, and therefore end in ſorrow. Before harueſt comes, all is withered, and they become vnfruitfull. They beganne not in humility, and therefore end not in glory. Nay they beganne in pride, and therefore end in ſhame. They beganne in impenitency, and therefore end in deſpaire. And thus haue we ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the definition of Repentance.</p>

                     <p>For the former; it is thus to be conſidered.</p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:197:14"/>
                     <p n="1">1. The ſpirit by the ſhrill trumpet of the Law arouſeth the ſinners drouſie conſcience, ſetteth his <note place="margin">1. The order of it.</note> ſinnes in order before him, and preſenteth him with that fearefull ſpectacle of eternall death and condemnation. And that ſo, that the poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſelfe-conuict, and ſelfe-condemned holding vp his guilty hands before Gods Tribunall, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the ſentence of death, doth not onely ſee hell with a wide and gaping mouth ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure him, but euen in a manner feeleth himſelfe in hell already; the terrours of God fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and the envenomed arrowes of the Almighty ſticking in his ribbes; ſo that in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity being brought downe to the very gate of hell, and feeling the very flaſhings of hell fire in his conſcience, he cries out, <hi>Miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me? Who ſhall deſcend into this deepe,</hi> to <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> helpe me out of the myre, wherein I ſticke ſo faſt?</p>
                     <p>A man in this caſe is like a rocke which with ſome mighty ſhaking is made to tremble, but yet ſtill retaines his hardneſſe; or as an iron veſſell which with ſome violent ſtroakes is broken into peeces, but theſe peeces remaine whole and hard, and are not yet molten by the fire. Now vnto hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation there is required not onely a broken, but alſo a contrite ſpirit. And Contrition is when all is ſtamped to very duſt, and ground as it were to powder, ſo that there is a through diſſolution of that which before was firmely hardened and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted together. But the Law of it ſelfe cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue and ſoften the hard heart of man: Therefore the ſinner though neuer ſo violently ſhaken and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:197:14"/> battred with the thunderbolts of the Law, is not as yet truely humbled, but onely prepared for, and in the way vnto humiliation. As when a thing is torne and broken, though into great and ſolide lumps, it is neerer to diſſolution, then when it was whole and entire.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Therefore the ſpirit by the hammer of the Law hauing broken vs, doth in the next place by the fire of the Goſpell melt vs. For the word of God <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23. 9. <hi>is both a hammer</hi> breaking the rockes, and a <hi>fire.</hi> A <hi>hammer</hi> in the Law: A <hi>fire</hi> in the Goſpell, which with the heat of Gods loue in Chriſt doth melt, mollifie, and diſſolue our hearts into the teares of godly ſorrow. For after that in the Law we haue ſeene our miſerable and deſperate eſtate in our ſelues, we ſhould preſently raue, and rage againſt the Lord, did hee not in this our extremity giue vs ſome hope and inckling of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; preſenting vnto our eye the infinite merits of Chriſt, the indefinite promiſes of the Goſpell, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all without exception to the fruition of thoſe merits, excluding none but ſuch as exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and deſpiſe the grace that is offered them. But when once mercy is tendred to vs that ſtand condemned in the Law, and that onely vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our humble &amp; ſubmiſſiue embracing of it, Oh then the working of our bowels! the ſtirring of our affections! the melting &amp; relenting of our repenting hearts! reaſoning thus with themſelues; And is it ſo indeed? hath the Lord giuen his owne Son to the death to ſaue ſinners? &amp; doth hee offer vs the benefit therof, who hauing been ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:197:15"/> Rebels againſt him ſtand caſt, and condemned euen in the ſentence of our own conſciences? What marble breſt, what oaken heart is there whom ſuch kindnes would not affect? How can we chuſe but out of loue and affection towards ſo ſweet and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a God, grieue, that euer we haue ſo grieued him?</p>
                     <p>And now hath Contrition it perfect worke in vs, when the bloud of the Lambe hath melted the Adamant, and the Sun-ſhine of Gods loue in Chriſt hath thawen the ice of our hearts. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the feare of hell, and ſo indeed ſelfe-loue, and in a manner pride that humbled vs, becauſe we would not be miſerable. But now it is the loue of God that humbleth vs, becauſe of the wrong wee haue done him, who hath done vs ſo much good. Before it was the hatred onely of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that made vs to grieue, but now it is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin (that brings the puniſhment) and that ſpecially, becauſe diſpleaſing to the Lord our good God, that cauſes all the trouble.</p>
                     <p>And thus we ſee in what order, and by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees Contrition is wrought.</p>
                     <p>But heere certaine queſtions may be mooued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Whether the ſole threatnings and curſes of the Law are not of themſelues auaileable vnto true contrition? foraſmuch as <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> heart melted in godly ſorrow, vpon the hearing of the <note place="margin">2. Chro. 34. 27</note> threatnings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe threatnings were not meerely Legall, but ſuch as were qualified with ſome tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of mercy in the Goſpell. Afflictions ſoften
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:197:15"/> our hearts, but how? no otherwiſe then as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Gods mercy in them: So did <hi>Ioſiah</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend mercy in thoſe threatnings, &amp; that they proceeded from Gods loue, and ſo accounted them as the wounds of a friend, and thence came the melting of his heart. <hi>Dauid</hi> relented euen at <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meies</hi> bitter reuilings, but it was through the ſenſe of Gods ſweet mercy in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Whether God keepe the order ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of conſtantly in humbling his children, ſo that none can truely be grieued for ſinne till they haue beene caſt downe with legall terrours?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Many may haue the firſt degree of humiliation by the Law, which neuer come to the ſecond by the Goſpell. As <hi>Iudas, Caine,</hi> and other Reprobates vtterly ouerwhelmed with the terrors of the Law, as children ſometimes in the trauell are killed with the paines thereof, before they can be borne. But as there can bee no birth without the paines of the trauell going before, ſo neither no true Repentance, without ſome terrours of the Law, and ſtreights of conſcience. None can haue the ſecond degree without the firſt.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon is plaine. None can haue Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but ſuch as Chriſt cals to Repentance. Now he cals onely <hi>ſinners to Repentance. Matth.</hi> 9. 13. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſinners heauy laden with the ſenſe of Gods wrath againſt ſinne. <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 29. He comes only to ſaue <hi>the loſt ſheep,</hi> that is, ſuch ſheep as feele them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues loſt in themſelues, and know not how to find the way to the folde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>Yee haue not againe receiued the ſpirit of bondage vnto feare;</hi> which ſhews
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:197:16"/> that once they did receiue it, namely, in the very firſt preparation vnto conuerſion, that then the ſpirit of God in the Law did ſo beare witneſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them of their bondage and miſerable ſlauery, that it made them to tremble. Now there vnder the perſon of the Romans, the Apoſtle ſpeaks to all beleeuers, and ſo ſhewes that it is euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians common caſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yet all are not handled alike. Though none wholly ſcape, yet ſome haue gentler fits then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſome are but ſprinkled in this baptiſme, wherein others are euen douſed ouer head and eares, and ſome doe but ſippe of that cuppe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of others drinke to the very dregges. It is with the trauell of a ſinner in his Repentance, as with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans in child-birth. None trauels heere without paine, yet ſome are like thoſe Hebrew women <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. and haue a farre quicker diſpatch then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. Thoſe conuerts <hi>Acts</hi> 2. in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance had ſome grudgings and <hi>prickes of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but yet they had none of <hi>Iobs</hi> nor <hi>Dauids</hi> fits which held them many dayes together. For the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> that wounded, preſently healed them, and being filled with the ioy of the holy Ghoſt, they comfortably conuerſed with the Chriſtians. <hi>Matthew</hi> as it is thought at his firſt conuerſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained Chriſt with a feaſt, and ſo did <hi>Lydia</hi> the Apoſtles, which they could not haue done, if they had beene in any extremities of the agonies of conſcience. God applies himſelfe heere to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall natures, conditions and diſpoſitions of his children.</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:197:16"/>
                     <p n="1"> 1. Some haue beene more hainous ſinners, and of longer ſtanding then the reſt. Now the more fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred and dangerous the wound is, the ſharper muſt be the cure. Some ſores will as eaſily bee let out with the pricking of a pinne, as others with the Surgeons launching. The more viſcous and glutinous the humour is, the ſtronger muſt the purge be. The greater the burthen is, the greater will bee the paine of the backe. Hence it was that <hi>Paul</hi> being a more hainous offender then the reſt of the Apoſtles, as being a malicious perſecutor, whereas they had beene honeſt and ſober fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, hence it was I ſay, that hee taſted deeper of this cup then they, as we ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 9. inſomuch that he ſayes the Law ſlew him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Hence alſo it is that ſuch who in their tender yeeres by meanes of religious nurture haue beene ſeaſoned with the grace of God, dropping by little and little into them, before any groſſer defilement of actuall tranſgreſſion, doe not behold that grim and ſeuere countenance of the Law, which thoſe commonly ſee who ſtand <hi>idle to the twelfth houre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. God meanes to employ ſome in more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſeruices. For the which hee ſees it fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them by the deepeſt humiliation. For the higher, and greater the building is, the deeper muſt the foundation be layd in the earth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some are of greater places and parts then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſome naturally of a more crabbed &amp; croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked diſpoſition, ſome more ſtout, bold, hardy then others. Now the hard knotty wood muſt haue a hard wedge. An angry word or looke workes
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:197:17"/> more vpon a ſoftly, then an hundred blows would vpon a croſſe and ſturdy ſpirit. Both theſe reaſons hold alſo in <hi>S. Paul</hi> that Prince of the Apoſtles, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God to bee a worthier inſtrument then the reſt, being a man of great parts &amp; ſingular lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and withall, as it ſhould ſeeme by the ſtory, of a fierce and fiery ſpirit. So great perſonages whoſe high places puffe them vp, that they may truely repent had need to be taken down through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a deep ſenſe of the legall terrors. For euen we poore worms that haue nothing almoſt either in regard of our parts or places to make vs ſwell, ſee yet, what a do we haue to be humbled, and what neede wee haue of the wedge of the Law, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to be driuen in throughly into our hearts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. To what end and purpoſe doth the Lord thus exerciſe his children, whom hee brings to repentance?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are more eſpecially ſixe reaſons of Gods proceeding in this manner.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To vrge them to ſeeke vnto Chriſt, as the hunted beaſt flies to his den, and the purſued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour to the hornes of the altar, and as vnder the Law the chaſed man-killer to his city of refuge.

Thus the deſtroying Angell droue the Iſraelites in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

This was it which made that young Prodigall to relliſh euen ſeruants fare, though before wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, when full fed at home. Nothing more vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoury to a ſenſeleſſe brawny heart then Chriſts bloud. No more relliſh feeles hee in it, then in a chip. But ô how acceptable is the fountaine of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing waters to the chaſed Hart panting and bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? The bloud of Chriſt to the weary and tired ſoule? to the thirſty conſcience ſcorched with the ſenſe of Gods wrath? He that preſents him with it how welcome is he? euen as a ſpeciall choyce man, one of a thouſand. The deeper is the ſenſe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, <note place="margin">Iob 33. 19. 23.</note> the ſweeter is the ſenſe of mercy. The tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour layd downe on the blocke is more ſenſible of his Soueraignes mercy in pardoning, then he who is not yet attached. Therefore cxcellently S. <hi>Paul, God hath ſhut vp all vnder ſinne, that hee might haue mercy on all.</hi> As though hee could not ſhew mercy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:197:18"/> without ſhewing iuſtice, becauſe wee cannot taſte the ſweet of his mercy, vnleſſe before our mouths be imbittered with the wormewood of his iuſtice. <hi>With thee the father lee ſhall finde mercy,</hi> ſaith repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Iſrael.</hi> When a man is brought into the ſtraits of a poore deſolate ſhiftleſſe orphane, then is hee fit for mercy. Sweetly <hi>Bernard, God poures not the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deus non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundit oleum miſericordiae niſi in vas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritum.</note> 
                        <hi>oyle of his mercy, ſaue into a broken veſſell.</hi> For indeed <hi>whole</hi> veſſels are <hi>full</hi> veſſels: And ſo Gods precious oyle would runne ouer, and be ſpilt on the ground if powred into them. Therefore firſt muſt they be emptied of their euill liquour; and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, vnleſſe Gods hand ſhake, tumble, batter and breake them, and then will they be capable of that oyle.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To worke a more perfect cure of their ſins. For the cure of the ſtone in the heart is like that of the ſtone in the bladder. God muſt vſe ſharpe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and come with his pulling and plucking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and rend the heart in peeces, ere that ſin can be got out of it. Euen as a tree that is deepely rooted in the earth, cannot be pluckt vp by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry roots, but the earth though firme before, muſt be broke vp. And as in a lethargie it is needefull the patient ſhould be caſt into a burning feuer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſenſes are benummed, and this will wake them, and dry vp the beſotting humors; ſo in our dead ſecurity before our conuerſion, God is faine to let the Law, Sinne, Conſcience and Sathan looſe vpon vs, and to kindle the very fire of hell in our ſoules, that ſo wee might bee rouſed: Our ſinnes ſticke cloſe vnto vs as the priſoners bolt, and wee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:197:18"/> are ſhut vp vnder them, as in a ſtrong priſon: and therefore vnleſſe, as once in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> their caſe, an <hi>earth-quake,</hi> ſo heere there come a mighty <hi>heart-quake,</hi> violently breaking open the priſon doores, and ſhaking of our fetters, neuer ſhall wee get our liberty. We goe on reſolutely and ſtoutly in our ſinnes, and vnleſſe wee bee ſcared as once <hi>Balaam</hi> in his couetouſneſſe by the naked ſword of the Lord threatning deſtruction, wee will neuer turne backe. How violently did Sathan driue <hi>Paul</hi> in the way of perſecution? Would he euer haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer, if a contrary winde had not encountred him, and blew him off his horſe, and ſmit him down to the ground dead and blinde? But then hee had his leſſon giuen him for euer perſecuting more. How now <hi>Paul</hi> is it good perſecuting? how now vnhappy venturous childe is it good running neer the fire, the water, when thy father ſhall take thee vp by the heeles, and ſcorch thee, and drench thee, and almoſt let thee quite fall in? How now <hi>Lot,</hi> is it good ſtaying in Sodome, when fire and brimſtone are comming about thine eares? If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> like <hi>of his broken bones,</hi> let him fall againe to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and adultery. If thou like the ſowre ſawce of a guilty helliſh conſcience, fall to the ſweet meat of thy ſin, and eat vnto ſurfet. But this ſowre ſawce makes the Elect of God loath their meat, though neuer ſo ſweete. When they ſee they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their right hands, eyes and feet, without ſuch aches, ſuch tortures, yea and danger of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the whole body, then they yeelde them to the cutting and mortifying hand of the Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:197:19"/> Then farwell profit, farwell pleaſure, treaſure and all, rather then I will endure ſuch a racke, ſuch a hell in my conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To make vs the more pliable to Gods will. How refractary was the woman of Samaria, till <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note> Chriſt ſat as a Iudge in her conſcience, and pinched her with that cloſe imputation of adultery. There was no dealing with <hi>Iob</hi> till the whirl-wind ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Iob.</note> him. An vnhumbled ſinner is as vnfit for Gods inſtruction, as an vnbroken colt for the ſaddle, and as the hard and clotty <hi>fallow ground</hi> not ſubdued by <note place="margin">Ierem. 4.</note> the plough is for the ſeede. Who can weilde a mightie hard rocke? but let it bee broken to fitters, and ſtamped to duſt, the hand of the Artificer may worke it as he will. When <hi>Iſay</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſ 6. Acts 9.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> were tamed with the terrors of the Lord, then, <hi>Lord heere I am. What wilt thou haue mee doe?</hi> When the Lyons and Beares are meekned, then a little childe may lead them. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 11. Hence thoſe ſpeeches, <hi>The Lord ſhall direct the humble. Humble</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſalm. 25. Mic. 6. 2. Chro. 30. 8. Ierem. 44. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>thy ſelfe to walke with thy God. Be not ſtiffe-necked, but giue the hand to the Lord, to be lead by him. They are not humbled, neither haue they walked in the wayes of the Lord.</hi> There is no more reſiſtance in a bruiſed heart againſt the Lord, then in ſoft waxe againſt the ſeale.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To procure vs the ſounder comfort. Whole ſores throb and rage. Eaſe is by breaking. The deeper the wound is ſearched and teinted, and the ſharper corraſiues be applied, the ſounder will the fleſh be afterward. The lower ebbe, the higher tide. The deeper our deſcent in <hi>Humiliation,</hi> the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:197:19"/> higher our aſcent in <hi>Conſolation.</hi> Therefore when Chriſt promiſeth vs his ſpirit to be our Comforter, he ſhewes this ſhall bee the firſt ground-worke of Comfort which hee ſhall lay, the <hi>conuincing of our conſcience of ſinne. I will ſend the Comforter, and hee</hi>

                        <hi>ſhall conuince the world of ſinne.</hi> A miſerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter one would thinke; no, but marke whether this Conuiction of ſinne tends. For it is added, that he ſhall <hi>conuince them of righteouſneſſe;</hi> After he hath ſoundly conuicted them of ſinne in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto condemnation. He ſhall to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts conuict their iudgements, and perſwade their hearts of righteouſneſſe in Chriſt vnto <hi>iustification.</hi> So the Prophet ſheweth how his peace was wrought out of his trouble, <hi>When I heard, my bellie</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hab. 3. 16.</note>

After the greateſt tempeſts the ſtilleſt calmes. Sanctified trouble eſtabliſhes peace. And the ſhaking of theſe windes makes the trees of Gods <hi>Eden</hi> take the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rooting.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. God heerein hath reſpect to his owne glory which he gaineth to himſelfe in working thus by contraries, ioy out of feare, light out of darkneſſe, heauen out of hell. When he meant to bleſſe <hi>Iacob</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 32.</note> he wreſtled with him as an aduerſary, euen till hee lamed him. When he meant to preferre <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to the <hi>throne,</hi> hee threw him downe into the <hi>dungeon;</hi> to the <hi>golden chaine</hi> about the <hi>necke,</hi> hee laded him <hi>with iron ones</hi> about his <hi>legges,</hi> and cauſed the <hi>iron to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 105.</note>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:197:20"/> 
                        <hi>enter into his ſoule.</hi> When he meant to make a moſt beautifull and orderly world, he makes firſt a vaſt gulfe, a groſſe <hi>Chaos,</hi> wherein was nothing but darkneſſe and confuſion: and yet out of it he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed light to ſhine, and out of it brought hee this goodly frame of heauen and earth which now wee ſee. Euen ſo in the ſecond creation which is by Regeneration, firſt there is nothing but a helliſh <hi>Chaos</hi> of darkeneſſe in the minde, of Confuſion in the heart, and yet at length comes forth the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt creature that euer was, the new creature in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Vſe of all this is,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To diſcouer their errour who thinke they haue true Repentance, when they haue only ſome legall qualmes of ſorrow, ſome ſtirrings and ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings of conſcience, which euen the fiends in hell haue, who yet are vncapable of Repentance. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe are preparations to Contrition as wee heard in the Elect, and are as the pricking of the needle before the thread. But contrition it ſelfe is a further matter. Chriſt biddes the heauy loaden come vnto him, and learne of him to bee humble. A man therefore may be heauy loaden, and as yet not come to him, nor truely humbled. When thoſe whom <hi>Peter</hi> pricked asked what they ſhould doe to be eaſed of that paine, hee preſcribed them Repentance, as the ſalue for that ſore of a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded conſcience. A man may haue a ſore, and feele it, and yet want the ſalue that ſhould heale it. And yet the feeling of the ſore is the firſt ſtep to recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For this makes vs enquire after the ſalue.</p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:197:20"/>
                     <p n="2"> 2. To terrifie ſuch as being ſtupefied in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and are wholly vnſenſible of ſinne, can car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it away lightly as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did the gates of the city, and their backes neuer complaine of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. Theſe blocks, that neuer in their life were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with Gods threatnings, neuer in any ſtraight of conſcience, neuer groaned vnder the burthen of Gods anger, they haue not ſo much as entred into the porch of this houſe, or lift the foote ouer the threſhold of this ſchoole of Repentance. In <hi>Dauids</hi> Repentance for numbring the people, this is noted at the firſt ſtep, <hi>his heart ſmote him,</hi> So in <note place="margin">2. Sam. 24.</note> his Repentance for adultery, hee notes this to bee the ground, <hi>My ſinne is euer before me.</hi> The terrible <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> image thereof affrights me continually. But for theſe Brutes, <hi>their ſinne is euer behinde them.</hi> Nothing is <hi>before them,</hi> but their profits, their pleaſures, their bagges, their barnes. And the delightfull image of theſe things ſo bewitches and beſots them, that they will neuer ſee the face of ſinne, till they feele the fire of hell. And iuſt it is, that ſuch who will not ſee ſinne heere by the <hi>light of Gods word,</hi> ſhould at laſt ſee it for euer by the <hi>light of the Diuels fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. To comfort ſuch as are diſtreſſed in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the apprehenſion of Gods wrath againſt their ſinne. It is a ſpeciall worke of the ſpirit thus to diſcouer vnto them their miſery, and in the ſight thereof to touch their heart. <hi>Yee haue not againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>the ſpirit of bondage vnto feare,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> The word <hi>Receiued</hi> implieth that the trouble of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to be accounted of, as a gift: and the word
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:197:21"/> 
                        <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhewes the author of the gift. Heere is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort then; thou art in the way to ſaluation, thou haſt receiued the firſt gift which the ſpirit beſtoweth vpon all thoſe whom it bringeth to Repentance, in that thou ſeeſt thy bondage, and trembleſt. Yea, but poore comfort thou wilt ſay, to behold and feele God as an enemy, with his ſword wounding me, &amp; then with his naile continually raking in the wounds, with his axe continually hewing and hacking mee, yea, and quite cutting me downe, and laying me flat on the ground. Silly man who ſeeſt not the depth of Gods wiſedome. Gods wounds are not mortall but medicinable, the wounds not of a Swaſh-buckler, that giues a gaſh and runnes away, but of a Surgeon that wounds and then heales; God ſees the Diuell hath giuen thee many a ſecret wound which will feſter, vnleſſe he heale them with theſe wounds of his. Gods axe hewes thee down not for the fire, but for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that thou mayeſt be a <hi>piller</hi> in his houſe. The <note place="margin">Reuel. 3.</note> Maſon pluckes downe an houſe, but not with an intent to deſtroy it, but to re-edifie it, and raiſe it vp againe in better forme and faſhion. God brings thee downe to the belly of hell, but it is but to bring the vp into the <hi>boſome of Abraham.</hi> Hee ſends his Sergeant to arreſt thee for thy debt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thee and all thou haſt to bee ſold. But hee doth but diſſemble, and hide his <hi>fatherly</hi> affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as once <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did his <hi>brotherly;</hi> His meaning is in concluſion to forgiue thee euery farthing. He ſcorches thee with the heate of his wrath, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts thee with a maruellous thirſt like that of <hi>Diues.</hi>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:197:21"/> But in the middeſt of thy extremity hee releeues thee as once <hi>Hagar,</hi> opening thine eyes to ſee that <note place="margin">Zach. 13. 1.</note> bleſſed <hi>Fountaine</hi> iſſuing out of the pierced ſide of Chriſt. He troubles thy heart, and ſtirres vp the mud of thy guilty conſcience, but it is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the Angel troubled the poole of <hi>Betheſda;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> now mayeſt thou expect health and helpe. The raine-bow though it threaten raine, yet it is a ſigne the world ſhall no more bee drowned with raine. So the wounds and terrors of conſcience, though they threaten damnation to the Elect, yet are they a ſigne, that they ſhall not be ouerwhelmed with it. Nay as the ſottiſh ſecurity of the wicked is a ſigne of vndoubted deſtruction, as in the olde worlds prophane worldlineſſe, and <hi>Baltaſhars</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious carouſings: ſo contrarily, heere terror and trouble are fore-runners of aſſured peace. As when they cry <hi>peace, peace,</hi> heauen, heauen, hell and perdition are at hand: ſo when theſe in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe cry, <hi>Hell, Hell, damnation, damnation,</hi> Heauen and ſaluation are at hand. And ſurely, much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is this hell which leades vnto, and ends in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Heauen, then that tranſitory heauen of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure worldlings, which ends in an euerlaſting hell. Happy then are wee if wee haue ſo our hell in this life, that we may haue our Heauen for euer in the life to come. Be not afrayd of this hell which will deliuer thee vp ſafely into Heauen: fear not that fal into Gods dungeon which ſhal rebound thee back into his palace.

Remembring that the ſhort paine of this Surgeons cutting of thee, ſhall eaſe thee of that continuall and farre heauier paine of the ſtone in thy heart. Surely, as when Chriſt called the blinde man the Diſciples ſayd. <hi>Be of good comfort, he calleth thee:</hi> ſo may I boldly ſay to all burthened in conſciencc: Be of good comfort, Chriſt Ieſus calleth you, ſaying, <hi>Come vnto mee all yee that are heauy loaden that I may eaſe you.</hi> If thou feeleſt the weight of this burthen now, there is <note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> one that will tranſlate it from thy ſhoulders to his owne. If not, thou ſhalt certainely feele it in the life to come; when thou alone muſt beare it for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.

The humiliation of the wicked is not ſo. If there were no ſparkes of fire in hell, there would bee no drops of water in their eyes. Their humiliation is wrung from them onely by the ſting and guilt of conſcience, which may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to let goe their hold of ſinne, and wiſh for the time to bee rid of it. The diſtemper and paine of the dogges ſtomacke, not the diſlike of the meat in it makes him caſt vp his gorge. For after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he returnes to his vomit.

                        <hi>wounded vs, and he will heale vs.</hi> The Reprobate in hell weepe and waile, and yet no godly ſorrow there, becauſe they cannot crie to God. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently <hi>Luther,</hi> Hell were no hell if the leaſt whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto God could bee heard there. Deſpaire ſtops the mouth of the Reprobate, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeake one word to God in their deiections, ſo as the godly do. As <hi>Ionas</hi> complaining of God in the whales belly, complaines yet to God, <hi>Thou haſt caſt me out.</hi> Whereas a Reprobate as <hi>Caluin</hi> notes, would haue ſayd, <hi>He</hi> hath caſt me away, in the third perſon.</p>
                     <p>Heere then is further triall of our ſorrow and Repentance, if as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes in another caſe, <hi>Wee mourne not without hope,</hi> if as the Lord inuites vs, we <note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 4. Iſ. 1. 18. Mar. 1. 15.</note> can <hi>come, and reaſon with him,</hi> if as Chriſt commands wee repent, and in repenting beleeue, that as our ſinne, ſo alſo Gods mercy be euer before vs. The wicked as they beleeue without repenting, their faith being preſumption, ſo they repent without beleeuing, their repentance is deſperation. And therfore they mutter and murmure, like the chaffe which when it is ſhaken, flutters in the face of the fanner, as angry with him. But the Godly are good wheat falling downe at the feete of the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as thoſe conuerts that humbled themſelues and ſought for eaſe of him that pricked them, <hi>Men</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> 
                        <hi>and brethren what ſhall we doe?</hi> And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue faith ſupporting them, that they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:197:24"/> ſincke not in the <hi>Deepes</hi> of Deſperation. As in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> in the 51. Pſalme; when begging mercy, his wounded conſcience obiected, the greatneſſe of his ſinnes, faith oppoſeth the greatneſſe and multitude of Gods mercies. <hi>According to the multitudes of thy compaſsions.</hi> And againe to that obiection of the deepe rooting of his ſinne, becauſe hee had lien in it three quarters of a yeere, Faith anſwers, <hi>Waſh me throughly.</hi> There is no ſtaine ſo deep, but thy hand can fetch it out. Heere <hi>Dauids</hi> faith plucked him out of the mire, and made him come to the Lord clinging and claſping about him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe it is offered vp to God as a ſeruice <note place="margin">3. It is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</note> and ſacrifice, and that with a free and voluntary ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>The ſacrifices of God are a broken and contrite ſpirit.</hi> The Godly are Agents in their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. For becauſe it is mingled with the ſenſe of ioy in the apprehenſion of Gods loue by faith, they take delight therein, and <hi>their teares become their meat, Pſal.</hi> 42. This voluntarineſſe of ſorrow in the Godly appeares in two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the Vſe of all good incentiues and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokements thereof. They worke and labour their hearts what they can thereto: according to that commandement <hi>Iames</hi> 4. <hi>Suffer affliction.</hi> And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing grieues them more then that they cannot grieue. But the wicked are meere patients in their ſorrow, becauſe wanting faith to temper the cup they drinke nothing but pure gall, yea, deadly poiſon. Hence thoſe ſtrugglings, thoſe wraſtlings with, and murmurings againſt God. With the ſturdy horſe they irefully champ the bit, and deſire
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:197:24"/> nothing more then to haue the deadly arrow fall out of our ſide. Hence thoſe ſo many ſleights of their feaſting, muſicke, mirth, paſtime to driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this ſo vnwelcome a ghueſt. Which the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue both inuited and welcommed with ſacke cloth, aſhes, faſting, going into the houſe of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, rending of cloathes, and powring foorth whole buckets of water, as ſome expound that 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In turning euery thing vnto ſorrow, worldly not onely griefes, but euen ioyes alſo. According to that of <hi>Iames, Let your laughter be turned into wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:</hi> that is, let your laughter be made the matter of your weeping. Let it bee the fuell to feede that fire. So doth repenting <hi>Salomon Eccl</hi> 2. out of the hony of his abuſed pleaſures hee gathers gall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Bee, ſucking ſweetneſſe out of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The pleaſant witted man will turne euerie thing to a leſt, euen ſad and ſerious: but the tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſinner euery thing vnto ſorrow, euen ſweete and ioyfull. The practiſe of <hi>Bradford</hi> that worthy <note place="margin">M. <hi>Samſons</hi> preface to his Sermon of Repentance.</note> Repentant in this kind was very memorable: who to this purpoſe booked euery notable accident each day that paſſed; and that ſo, that in the penning a man might ſee the ſignes of his ſmitten heart. For if he did ſee or heare any good in any man; by that ſight he found and noted the want thereof in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, crauing mercy and grace to amend. If he did ſee or heare any plague and miſery, he noted it as a thing procured by his owne ſinnes, and ſtill added, <hi>Lord haue mercy on me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe it keeps our hearts in a bleſſed frame <note place="margin">4. It fits for holy duties.</note>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:197:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> of godlineſſe; fitting them for prayer, meditation, reading, hearing, conference, admonition, or any other ſpirituall duty. Worldly ſorrow is a heauy leaden thing, making a man fitter to ſleepe then to pray, as we ſee in <hi>Ionas,</hi> and the Diſciples. But god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow in the ſenſe of Gods loue is freſh and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and full of ſpirits. We neuer pray or performe any Chriſtian duty better, then when our hearts are fulleſt of this ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Againe, it makes the heart exceeding ſoft and tender, and ſo ſenſible euen of the leaſt ſinnes. As <hi>Dauids</hi> heart ſmote him for cutting off but the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> coate, and for the entertainement of euill motions, <hi>Why art thou diſquieted, why fretteſt thou my</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>ſoule.</hi> It makes the heart like the eye that will feele the leaſt mote, or like a ſtraight ſhooe that cannot endure the leaſt pebble ſtone, which in a wide one would neuer be perceiued.</p>
                     <p>And thus we ſee the properties of true Sorrow or Contrition, that it is both a <hi>louing</hi> Sorrow, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the loue and affection of our hearts towards the Lord, and a <hi>beleeuing</hi> Sorrow, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to God, and faſtening vpon his mercy, and a <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> Sorrow, delightfully bathing it ſelfe in her teares, and laſtly, a ſoft and <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted</hi> Sorrow, working a diſpoſition vnto deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore woorthily called godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And of the nature of humiliation ſo much.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. Of the meaſure of Humiliation.</head>
                     <p>THe next point is touching the meaſure of Humiliation or Sorrow for ſinne. Where I <note place="margin">2. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it.</note> propound three rules.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Rule.</hi> Of all other ſorrowes, ſorrow for ſin muſt be the greateſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. Griefe is founded in loue. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as our loue is, ſo is our griefe. But our loue of God, and his fauour is the greateſt loue, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our griefe for his offence by ſinne, the greateſt griefe. Therefore as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaies, <hi>Thou haſt giuen me</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſalm. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>more ioy in the light of thy countenance, then they haue had when their corne &amp; oile abounded:</hi> So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary muſt euery Chriſtian ſay, I haue had more griefe in procuring thy diſpleaſure by ſinne, then the worldlings haue had in the miſcarriage of their corne and oyle. 2. According to the greatneſſe of the Euill muſt ſorrow be proportioned. Now of the two Euils, the Euill of ſinne is farre greater then the Euill of puniſhment. For it is onely ſinne that grieues the ſpirit of God, and depriues vs of the fauour of God. <hi>Affliction and Gods ſpirit can agree very well.</hi> Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing true bleſſedneſſe remooues nothing from it but ſinne, as being that which onely makes vs miſerable. <hi>Surely they</hi> [the bleſſed men] <hi>worke no iniquity.</hi> And not, <hi>ſurely they ſuffer no aduerſitie.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 3.</note>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:197:26"/> Sinne therefore being the greateſt Euill, craues the greateſt ſorrow. 3. The precepts and examples in the Scripture ſhew as much. Though in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow baldneſſe was forbidden the Iewes, yet in ſorrow for ſinne it was commanded them. <hi>The Lord calleth vnto mourning, &amp;c. and vnto baldneſſe,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſay 22. 13.</note> ſaith <hi>Eſay.</hi> A plaine argument of a greater ſorrow expected for ſinne, then they ought to haue for any outward worldly croſſe whatſoeuer. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayes, <hi>his eyes guſhed out with riuers of water</hi> for other mens <note place="margin">Pſal. 1 19.</note> ſinnes. What then did they for his owne? Great is that <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> and it argueth an <hi>hyperbolicall</hi> and exceſſiue ſorrow; <hi>I cauſed my bed euery night to ſwim,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 6. 6.</note> and not only ſo, <hi>but water my pallet</hi> that lies beneath my bed, <hi>with my teares.</hi> Implying, that if his head could containe ſo much water, the griefe of his heart could furniſh it. In the ſame ſenſe doe ſome take that of the repenting <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they drew <note place="margin">1. Sam. 7.</note> water, and powred it out before the Lord. And thus doth <hi>Zacharie</hi> deſcribe the ſorrow of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentants, that euen after plenty of teares and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations <note place="margin">Zach. 12.</note> in publique, yet the fountaine ſhall runne ſtill in priuate, and flow from the Church to the priuate cloſet, euery ſoule mourning in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret by himſelfe. And which is ſtrange, that the lamentations of one poore woman weeping ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in her cloſet, ſhall equall that great <hi>mourning</hi> of the whole multitude in the <hi>valley of Megiddo</hi> for the death of <hi>Ioſiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Farre then are they from Repentance, who though they can cry and howle on their beddes when their money, their houſes, their lands are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:197:26"/> gone, what ſpeake I of ſo great matters? The death of a cowe, or the loſſe of a few pigges will pinch them ſore. And yet their maine, and fearefull ſins could neuer yet draw ſo much as one teare from their eyes, or fetch one ſigh from their hearts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Are <hi>Teares</hi> neceſſarily required in this ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Sometimes want of teares proceeds from abundance of griefe, ſo oppreſſing the minde that it cannot eaſe it ſelfe by weeping. As in him that weeping at the death of his friend, could not yet weepe at the death of his owne ſonne.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sometimes the conſtitution of the body will yeeld no teares. The triall heere is the ſame, as in the matter of memory. If a man haue a naturall defect in his memory, which is the cauſe hee can remember but very little of a ſermon, then neither will hee remember much of a tale, of a play, of worldly matters. So if the conſtitution or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion deny teares in ſorrow for ſinne, neither will it affoord them in worldly ſorrow. But as thy ability to remember worldly matters, when thou haſt none to remember Gods, argues no <hi>naturall infirmity,</hi> but a <hi>ſinnefull corruption</hi> of memory, ſo is it heere. If thou can weepe plentifully for worldly loſſes, and yet haue dry cheekes for thy ſins, this is from the <hi>corruption</hi> of thy heart, not from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> of thy body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. May not the childe of God feele more griefe for ſome worldly croſſes, then he doth for his ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Sorrow may be conſidered either as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:197:27"/> it is in the will, and ſo it is nothing but the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and diſlike of that which the vnderſtanding apprehendeth as euill. Or as it is in the ſenſitiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the ſoule, common with vs to the beaſts. In the former way Gods children feele greateſt <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Thom. ſupplem. qu.</hi> 4 <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>Bellar. de poen. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> ſorrow for ſinne. Their will ſanctified and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the ſpirit deteſts, abhors nothing more then to ſinne againſt God. But yet all the children of God doe not feele ſuch a ſenſible ſtinging ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting griefe for their ſinne in the ſenſitiue faculty, as they doe for diuers outward afflictions. For the more corporall a thing is, the neerer is it, and more familiar to the ſenſitiue faculty, and ſo pinches more there. For example: in extremity of tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, or in the burning of ones finger, there is a more ſenſible griefe felt, then in a lingring feuer, or then is ſometimes in death it ſelfe. And yet the will gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by right reaſon diſlikes the feuer and death far more then the tooth-ach.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Greatneſſe of griefe may be meaſured either by the <hi>violent intenſion,</hi> or by the conſtant <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> and <hi>duration.</hi> Now that which is wanting to the griefe of Gods children for their ſinnes the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way, is recompenced, and made vp in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Their griefe for ſinne is not ſo extreamely vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, becauſe of the ioy and comfort of the holy Ghoſt, which they feele in the middeſt of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe: and yet this ioy doth not any way leſſen the diſpleaſure of our wils againſt ſinne (though it qualifie the ſenſible ſmart) nay rather it encreaſes it. For as ioy and delight in learning makes the ſcholler learne the better, ſo delight in godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:197:27"/> ſets vs forward in it, but yet as we ſayd it miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates the extremity of paſſion ſo, that oftentimes the children of God are for the time more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tormented for their croſſes, then for their ſinnes. As <hi>Dauid</hi> cried out vehemently, <hi>O Abſalom, Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> but not <hi>O Vriah, Vriah.</hi> Yet his griefe for <hi>Vriahs</hi> death was a more ſetled &amp; conſtant griefe, as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſtilleſt waters are deepeſt. <hi>My ſinne is euer before me,</hi> ſo was not <hi>Abſolons death.</hi> That was ſoon ouer. <hi>Iob</hi> ſayes, that <hi>he poſſeſſed the ſins of his youth,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iob. 13. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>euen in his olde age:</hi> but he ſayes not that he poſſeſſed the afflictions of his youth. Time had worne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thoſe ſorrowes: for they are but like a ſudden daſhing tempeſt, but ſorrow for ſinne is like the ſtill, ſoft, but ſoaking raines that wets to the very rootes. The one is like a mighty torrent or land-flood, ſoone dried vp, or a blaze of thornes ſoone extinct, the other like a little ſpring alwayes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or a conſtant fire holding out the whole day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> Wee are bidden reioyce alwayes, how then can wee ſorrow alwaies for our ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe two may well ſtand together, becauſe godly ſorrow miniſters matter to vs of ioy. Let the Repentant alwaies ſorrow and reioice <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Semper doleat poenitens, &amp; de dolore gaudeat.</hi> Pro. 14.</note> in, and for his ſorrow, ſaith <hi>Auſtin.</hi> As in prophane ioy, euen in laughing the heart is ſorrowfull, ſo in godly ſorrow, euen in weeping the heart is light and cheerefull. Though ſinne grieue vs, yet our grieuing for ſinne pleaſes vs. As when wee ſee a good man wronged, we greeue at his wrong, but reioyce in his goodneſſe. 2. Though <hi>actuall</hi> ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:197:28"/> and reioycing may ſeeme not ſo well to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, yet <hi>habituall</hi> may. Yea, habituall ſorrow may ſtand with actuall ioy; and contrarily; now when we ſay, A Repentant muſt alwayes be ſorrowfull, we meane <hi>habitually,</hi> in regard of the preparation of heart, ſo that hee doe nothing contrary to this ſorrow, which ſhould take away the diſpoſition of his heart thereto, but alwaies maintaine a purpoſe to diſlike, and be diſpleaſed with ſinne. And thus are all thoſe precepts, of reioycing, praying, giuing thankes alwaies to be vnderſtood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Vſe.</hi> This giues a checke to the ſlightneſſe of our ſorrow for ſinne. A ſigh and away, no, but we muſt feede and nouriſh this ſorrow, neuer ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſelues, but wiſh with the Prophet, that <hi>our heads were continuall,</hi> vnemptiable <hi>fountaines of teares.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ierem 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Mine eye droppeth without ſtay,</hi> ſaith the repenting Church of Iſrael. But how ſoone are our teares dryed vp? If this plaiſter of ſorrow begin to ſmart a little, preſently we plucke it off, and thinke tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: whereas we ſhould let it lie on till the ſore be throughly healed, which is not till death, when as <hi>all teares,</hi> and ſo theſe of godly ſorrow ſhall bee <hi>wiped away. Paul</hi> in the height of his Chriſtianity ſtill continued mourning, <hi>I am carnall,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>man,</hi> &amp;c. Euen the beſt of vs carry about vs the matter of our humiliation, the poyſoned root of ſinne, which is continually branching foorth ſome corruption or other. Our hearts are <hi>continuall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of ſinne,</hi> and therefore our heads alſo muſt be <hi>continuall fountaines of ſorrow,</hi> to allay in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the ſtench of that filthy puddle. <hi>Peter</hi> after his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:197:28"/> bitter teares was yet thrice pinched with that nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping queſtion, <hi>Symon loueſt thou me?</hi> that he might yet be more ſeriouſly humbled. And to the ſame <note place="margin">Ioh. 21.</note> purpoſe would God needes ſpeake the ſecond time out of the whirle-winde, to <hi>Iob</hi> though repenting at the firſt ſpeaking. So repenting <hi>Ionas</hi> muſt bee <note place="margin">Iob 40.</note> throwen into the ſea, and humbled, <hi>Dauid</hi> muſt be further humbled with the loſſe of his childe, with the treaſons and villanies of <hi>Abſolon.</hi> God would neuer haue the wounds of godly ſorrow ſo skinned vp, but that they may bee ready to bleede a freſh vpon euery occaſion. Yea, he would haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall iſſue kept in them. <hi>Dauid</hi> mourned at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> rebuke: but that mourning could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him. He goes to it a freſh in the 51. Pſalme, and euen ſoakes and ſouſes himſelfe in this brine. It is a deep and piercing ſorrow that God requires. Euen ſuch a one that ſhould drowne all other ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. As when the ſtone and gout meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the paine of the ſtone beeing the more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, takes away the ſenſe of the gout: euen ſo ſhould it be with vs heere.

                     <p>For our direction therefore heerein know that in this ſearch wee muſt labour to finde out two things.</p>

                     <p>In the ſearch of ſinne, both <hi>Originall</hi> and <hi>Actuall</hi> ſinne muſt be found out.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For Originall ſinne, we muſt know that in it are two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Guilt</hi> of the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> in eating the forbidden fruit. For in <hi>Adam</hi> as the roote of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:197:34"/> all mankinde we all ſinned. And if wee had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent ſinne of our owne, this imputed ſinne of <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> his were enough to damne vs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That which neceſſarily followeth vpon the former; The generall corruption, and deprauati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our whole nature: and it conſiſts in theſe two points.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The whole man is in Euill. Euery part and power of ſoule and body is infected with this le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie: from the Crowne of the head to the ſoales of the feet, there is nothing but boiles and botches.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whole euill is in man; that is to ſay, the ſeeds of, and ſo a fitneſſe to all ſinnes, euen the moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. As the <hi>Chaos</hi> at the firſt creation had the ſeeds <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 2.</note> of all creatures, and wanted onely the ſpirits mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bring them foorth: ſo this <hi>Chaos</hi> and maſſe of ſinne hath the ſeedes of all ſinnes, and wants but the powerfull motion of Sathan, and warmth of his temptations to hatch euen Cockatrices, and ſuch like poyſoned monſters. O how ſhould this humble vs to thinke what venomed natures wee haue, ſo that neuer was there any villany commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any forlorne Miſcreant wherunto we haue not a diſpoſition in our ſelues. We cry out of <hi>Cain, Iudas, Iulian,</hi> the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Why, we carry them all in our own boſoms. They are but glaſſes to ſee our <note place="margin">Prou. 27. 19.</note> faces in: as in the water, face anſwereth to face, ſo doth the heart of man to man, ſaith <hi>Salomon.</hi> As there is a full agreement twixt the liuing face, and the repreſentation in the water, ſo twixt <hi>Iudas</hi> his heart, and any other mans: as there is the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all lyons, ſo of all men.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. For Actuall ſinnes, we muſt ſearch out what we can.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The number.</item>
                        <item>2. The hainouſneſſe of them.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. As touching the number, diuers directions for ſearch may be giuen.</p>
                     <p>A man may conſider himſelfe according to thoſe diuers relations wherein he ſtands bound to God, to himſelfe, to his brethren, either in the Church as a Miniſter, in the Common-wealth as a Magiſtrate, in the family as father, mother, childe, maſter, ſeruant, husband, wife. Now a man ſhould carry himſelfe along through all theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and examine himſelfe of the diſcharge of his duty, and in euery one of them.</p>
                     <p>Or elſe he may deuide his time according to the ſeuerall places and conditions, wherein hee hath paſſed it. So much time ſpent in my Parents fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſo much in apprentiſhippe: ſo much in ſingle life: ſo much in marriage: ſo much priuately: ſo much in this or that publique calling: ſo much in this towne, ſo much in that: ſo much in this houſe, ſo much in that. And heere he muſt examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe how he hath filled vp the empty ſpaces of his houres; what good he hath done in theſe ſeuerall portions of time.</p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:197:35"/>
                     <p>But the beſt way of examination is by the Law of the ten commandement truely vnderſtood, and applied. For many will acknowledge themſelues ſinners <hi>in groſſe,</hi> but come to the particulars of the Law, and then they are innocent, they neuer brake either the firſt, or ſecond, or third &amp;c. comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. Like as if a man ſaying he were ſicke, and being thereupon asked where, and led a long from his head to the feete, ſhould yet then be well in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular part. The reaſon is, becauſe the Law is not vnderſtood by them; <hi>For by the Law</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom 3.</note> (vnderſtood) <hi>comes the knowledge of ſinne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore to helpe vs in examining our hearts by the Law, theſe rules of interpretation muſt bee remembred. 1. Vnder the negatiue, the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue is comprehended. When euill is forbidden, the contrary, good is commanded. 2. Vnder one good or euill action, all of the ſame kinde or nature are comprehended, yea, all occaſions and meanes leading thereto. 3. The Law is ſpirituall, and bindes euen the heart and thoughts thereof. 4. The Law requires not onely our <hi>obſeruation,</hi> but <hi>preſeruation,</hi> that is, that we doe not only keep it our ſelues, but cauſe others alſo what in vs lieth to keep it. And therefore it forbids not only the doing of euill our ſelues, but helping, or any way furthering of others, though but by ſilence, conniuence, or ſlight reproofe, as that of <hi>Eli</hi> to his ſonnes. This rule is gathered out of the fourth commandement; Thou, thy ſonne &amp;c. which by proportion muſt be applied to all the reſt. 5. That ſpecially wee muſt ſearch our ſelues by the firſt and laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:197:36"/> for that they pierce deeper then the reſt, euen to thoughts not conſented to.</p>
                     <p>Thus conceiuing of the Law lay it to thy heart, and try thy ſelfe by it, and loe with <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſtill ſhalt thou ſee new, and <hi>freſh abhominations</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Command. <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no other Gods but mee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou wilt ſay, I beleeue that there is onely one true God, maker of heauen and earth, and I defie all the Idols of the Heathen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, but the Law is ſpirituall, and claimes the heart, the affections, the thoughts. In the which looke how many ſinnes are cheriſhed, ſo many falſe gods are there choſen, as it were <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabaſſes</hi> rather then Chriſt. Looke how many creatures thou inordinately loueſt, feareſt, truſteſt, reioyceſt in, ſo many new gods haſt thou coyned: and wilt thou then plead not guilty this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement arraigning thee?</p>
                     <p>2. Command. <hi>Thou ſhalt not make any grauen image.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O ſayes one, I abhorre the Popiſh images, and the idolatry of the maſſe. Yea, but vnder the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, the affirmatiue is comprehended. Doeſt thou loue the true worſhip of God, as thou hateſt the falſe. Thou deteſteſt Popiſh faſting; loueſt thou true faſts? Thou loatheſt the maſſe: Delighteſt thou in the ſupper of the Lord? Thou deſpiſeſt the Prieſts of Antichriſt: Reuerenceſt thou the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt? Theſe interrogatories will poſe and pulſe many.</p>
                     <p>3. Command. <hi>Take not Gods name in vaine.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>I heare thee ſaying; I cannot away with ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Yea, but doeſt thou reprooue others ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>Leu.</hi> 5. 1. for the Law muſt be <hi>preſerued,</hi> not <hi>obſerued</hi> onely. Againe, vnder Gods name is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended his word, workes, and whatſoeuer it is whereby he makes himſelfe knowen, According to the rule, vnder one kinde &amp;c. And diddeſt thou neuer heare ſermons vnpreparedly, irreuerently? &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>4. Command. <hi>Keepe holy the Sabaoth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why we worke not; we trauell not. Wee come to Church. Yea, but the Law is ſpirituall, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth euen the reſt of thy heart from worldly thoughts, much more of thy tongue from worldly ſpeeches. And how often haſt thou here offended.</p>
                     <p>5. Command. <hi>Honour thy father &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O I ſhould be vnnaturall if I did not ſo. Yea, but thy Magiſtrate, thy Miniſter, thy Husband, thy Maſter, thy Superiours are thy Fathers alſo. And haſt thou no way failed in performance of honour to all theſe? And thou that art any of theſe fathers haſt thou preſerued this Law? or rather by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming carriage haſt thou not inuited thy infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours to contemne thee?</p>
                     <p>6. Command. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heere thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe innocent indeede. Yea, but there is a murther of the heart, hatred, wrath &amp;c. Perhaps by greeuing the heart of thy brother vniuſtly thou haſt ſhortned his dayes. Or if free from bodily murther, yet haply thou haſt murthered his ſoule by thy negligence, by thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill example.</p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:197:37"/>
                     <p>7. Command. <hi>Againſt Adultery.</hi>

                     <p>Here alſo the luſt of the heart, yea, the vſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prouokements thereof, as idleneſſe, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, gluttony, wanton bookes, lookes, pictures, dances, ſpeeches, veſture, geſture are ſufficient to make thee guilty before God: yea, winking at it in others.</p>
                     <p>8. Command. <hi>Againſt ſtealing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heere euen Couetouſneſſe is a Pick-purſe before God. Yea, and not to vphold the eſtate of our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſtealing, for the poore are made owners of part of our goods. <hi>Prou.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>9. Command. <hi>Againſt falſe witneſſe bearing.</hi>

                     <p>Where lying, flattering, detracting, liſtning to tales, yea, not giuing teſtimony to thy brothers name, and commending Gods grace in him, makes thee guilty.</p>
                     <p>10. Command. Cuts to the very quicke, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the very firſt motions of ſinnes ſpringing out of our hearts, though reiected preſently.</p>
                     <p>Well then, this filthy dunghill, how euer vnſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it did not annoy vs, yer after this raking in it the ſtench will bee intollerable. Though in our blindneſſe wee might pleaſe our ſelues, yet when our eyes are opened to looke in this glaſſe, ô what vgly creatures ſhall wee thinke our ſelues then? Though in the darke ſeeing no danger, wee were feareleſſe, yet by this light diſcerning not onely the beames, but euen the leaſt moates, and ſeeing ſo infinite a ſwarme of ſinnes, yea, an army of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities incompaſſing vs, how can we chuſe but be confounded in our ſelues, and forced to cry out

                     <p n="2">2. Beſides the number of our ſinnes, their hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe muſt alſo be found out. A ſore which at firſt ſeemes nothing, by reaſon of the ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of skin that is broken, afterward being ſearched, and launched, and the dead fleſh taken out, the hole is much greater then before.

                     <p>In this ſearch alſo the place where, and the time

                     <p>The parts of confeſſion are two. 1. Accuſing of our ſelues. 2. Iudging of our ſelues.</p>
                     <p>Both theſe are neceſſary duties. For by accuſing <note place="margin">1. Accuſation In which.</note> our ſelues we preuent <hi>Sathan;</hi> by iudging our ſelues we preuent God. When we haue <hi>accuſed</hi> our ſelues
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:197:40"/> what can Sathan that <hi>accuſer</hi> of the brethen ſay, which wee haue not ſayd before, ſo his mouth is ſtopt: Hee comes too late: wee being <hi>Accuſers,</hi> God is our <hi>Diſcharger,</hi> and what then ſhall Sathan be but a <hi>Slanderer?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By iudging of our ſelues, doe wee likewiſe put God out of office: for he will ſay, loe how this man iudgeth himſelfe: I will not therefore iudge him. If in <hi>Ahabs</hi> hypocryticall iudging, ſeeſt thou not <note place="margin">1. Kin. 21. 29</note> how <hi>Ahab</hi> humbleth himſelfe, I will not therefore humble him, how much more in the ſincere and ſeuere iudging of the Godly. Indeed in iudging of others, Iudge not leaſt ye be iudged; but in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 1.</note> of our ſelues, iudge that ye be not iudged. <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for the former, namely the accuſing of our <note place="margin">Three things</note> ſelues, there muſt be theſe three things therein.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A particularizing of our ſinnes. In an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation <note place="margin">1. Particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of ſinne.</note> it is not enough to accuſe in generall, but we muſt come to particulars, and charge the accuſed with this or that crime. How can the Phyſitian helpe him that ſaies he is not well, and will not tell him where. Many deale with God in the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſinnes, as <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters <note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> about his dreame: that hee had dreamed hee told them, and deſired an interpretation; but what his dreame was he could not tell. So many confeſſe themſelues ſinners, and deſire pardon. But wherein they haue ſinned, and what their ſinnes are, they cannot, or will not tell. Generall Confeſſions, and <hi>in groſſe,</hi> are too <hi>too groſſe.</hi> No, they muſt be particularly remembred, and ranked, and ſorted together in order.</p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:197:40"/>
                     <p n="2"> 2. And beeing thus ſet in order, ſome of thy chiefeſt ſinnes muſt be culled out, which haue bin <note place="margin">2. Calling out the chiefe.</note> moſt diſhonourable to God, and diſcomfortable to thine owne ſoule. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> in his confeſſion inſiſts ſpecially in that grand and capitall ſinne of perſecution. <hi>I perſecuted the Church of God.</hi> And ſo thoſe Iſraelites. <hi>Beſides all other our ſinnes, wee haue</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 13. 1. Sam. 12. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>ſinned in asking a King.</hi> For he that truely and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly repents of one ſinne, ſpecially his deereſt and ſweeteſt ſinne, will much more repent of his other leſſer ſinnes. Hee that will ſhake off his greateſt friends, will much more forſake the meaner, and leſſe reſpected. And indeed vſually Repentance is firſt occaſioned by ſome one ſpeciall hainous ſinne layd to heart. The Apoſtles <hi>Acts</hi> 2. doe ſpecially preſſe the murther of Chriſt vpon the Iewes, and <hi>Acts</hi> 17. Ignorance vpon the Athenians, &amp; Chriſt adultery vpon the woman of Samaria, calling her to repentance. As in battels, though they fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole Army, yet ſpecially againſt the Head and Generall; as <hi>Fight neither againſt great,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Kin. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>nor ſmall, but againſt the King of Iſrael:</hi> ſo ſpecially we muſt ſet our ſelues in our confeſſion againſt our Maſter ſinnes; the King being caught, the reſt will neuer ſtand out.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Though we muſt ſpecially dwell vpon ſome of our moſt ſpeciall ſinnes, yet the reſt muſt not be <note place="margin">3. Yet not neglecting the reſt.</note> neglected: for as <hi>Confeſsion</hi> muſt be <hi>particular,</hi> ſo alſo muſt it be <hi>full.</hi> And our more greeuous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt bring the reſt to our remembrance. As <hi>Dauids</hi> murther and adultery brought euen his birth-ſinne to his minde. And that ſin of ſtrange <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:197:41"/> wiues many other ſinnes to <hi>Eſraes</hi> minde. As we in correcting our children for one fault thereupon <note place="margin">Eſr. 9.</note> remember them of, and reckon with them for ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other before; and as in accuſation, when a man is endited of ſome ſpeciall crime, his enemies vpon that occaſion bring in whatſoeuer elſe they can get againſt him, further to diſgrace him: ſo heere in accuſing our ſelues nothing willingly muſt bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Take wee heede of ſpirituall guile in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ought. Thou mayeſt hide God from thy ſelfe, thy ſelfe from God thou canſt not. To the Phyſician thou wilt diſcouer euen thy moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſeaſes, the fruites of thy filthy wickedneſſe. If thou ſhouldeſt conceale but one circumſtance of ſuch a diſeaſe, it might kill thee. And ſixe theeues being entred into thy houſe, if thou ſhouldeſt let but one of them alone vnſearched, and vndiſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hee would ſerue the turne to cut thy throat, and ſteale thy treaſure. Thou muſt then powre out thy <hi>whole heart as water,</hi> as the Prophet <note place="margin">Lam. 2. 19. opened.</note> ſpeaketh: which ſome of the <hi>Ancient</hi> haue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted of a full confeſſion, when nothing is left out. As in powring out of water euery drop goes out, not ſo in powring out of oyle.</p>
                     <p>Yet in ſome caſes the omiſſion of ſome perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſinnes is excuſable. As firſt, in want of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>memorie.</hi> Heere to cry out with <hi>Dauid;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Who knoweth the errors of his life? Clenſe me from my ſecret ſinnes,</hi> ſhall be accepted. Secondly, in want of <hi>leyſure;</hi> as when a man is ſuddenly preuented by the hand of God, as the theefe on the croſſe, or by extreame and violent ſickneſſe. Heere to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:197:41"/> thy chiefe ſinnes, as he his ſtealing, and for the reſt to confeſſe generally is accepted in mercy of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of confeſſion is the <hi>iudging</hi> of <note place="margin">2. Iudging our ſelues. Iob. 39. 37. Prou. 30. 2. 2. Sam. 24.</note> our ſelues. Firſt, for the nature, or quality of our ſinnes; wherein wee muſt bee moſt ſeuere againſt our ſelues, ſo was <hi>Iob. I am vile; Agar. I am not a man, I haue not the vnderſtanding of a man in me; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. I haue done exceeding fooliſhly.</hi> Though before he thought he had done exceeding wiſely. So <hi>Paul</hi> iudges himſelfe the <hi>head of ſinners, the leaſt of the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 15. 1. Cor. 15 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yea of Saints, yea leſſe then the leaſt. He giues himſelfe the higheſt place among ſinners, the loweſt among Saints. Secondly, for the deſert of our ſinnes. Heere wee muſt paſſe the ſentence of the Law, adiudging our ſelues to death, &amp; ſo ſtand before Gods tribunall as guilty perſons with ropes about our necks. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 31. <hi>Then ſhall ye iudge your ſelues worthy to bee cut off. Daniel.</hi> 9. <hi>Shame be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>longs to vs. Luk.</hi> 15. <hi>I am not woorthy to be called thy ſonne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe be the <hi>parts</hi> of Confeſſion: the <hi>manner</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; <note place="margin">2. Manner of it in 6. things.</note> wherein ſixe things are required.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Confeſſion muſt be in <hi>Faith</hi> of Gods mercy, <note place="margin">1 In Faith.</note> for forgiueneſſe of, and helpe againſt the ſinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. Wee muſt confeſſe, not as the conuicted malefactor to the Iudge, as <hi>Achan</hi> to <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> who aſſures himſelfe of certaine death, and lookes for no fauour; but as the ſicke man to the Phiſition, that hath hope to be cured by him. And here our faith is ſurer a great deale. For we cannot ſo aſſure our ſelues eyther of the will, or skill of the Phyſitian
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:197:42"/> to heale vs as of Gods: neither that in the matter of ſhame he will be ſo faithfull to vs, as God. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men confeſſe as <hi>Iudas, I haue ſinned,</hi> but deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire ſwallows them vp. When they acknowledge their fault, they ſeeke not Gods mercie; as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet excellently bringeth in God coupling theſe <note place="margin">Hoſ. 5. 15.</note> two together, <hi>Till they acknowledge their fault, and ſeeke mee.</hi> So did <hi>Daniel, yet there is mercy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Dan 9. Ezr. 10. 2.</note> And <hi>Shecaniah, wee haue ſinned: yet there is hope in Iſrael concerning this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It muſt be in <hi>ſhame,</hi> with annihilated, deiected and confounded ſpirits, as <hi>Eſra. O my God I am aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. In ſhame. Ezra. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>and confounded to lift vp mine eies to Heauen:</hi> for though faith bee <hi>confident,</hi> yet not <hi>impudent.</hi> Though <hi>Eſra</hi> had faith, and called God his God, yet was hee aſhamed with his ſinne, though not with the ſhame of a condemned malefactor, yet of a good Sonne or Subiect offending his Father, or Soueraigne. The wickeds preſumptuous faith is a ſhameleſſe faith; it makes them ſhameleſſe in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and their ſhame is a faithleſſe and deſperate ſhame; They cannot in their ſhame call God their God with <hi>Ezra:</hi> But both theſe muſt goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Many in confeſſing begge mercy with the <hi>Publicane,</hi> but their eyes are not caſt downe in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhame as his were. They are not touched with any ſerious ſenſe of their owne vileneſſe, to thinke with <hi>Iob,</hi> duſt and aſhes good enough for them. I <hi>haue ſinned</hi> ſaith <hi>Saul, yet I pray thee honour mee in the ſight of the people.</hi> Lo a proud and high mind in <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 30.</note> confeſſion, where our intent principally ſhould be to ſhame and abaſe our ſelues. </p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:197:42"/>
                     <p n="3"> 3. In <hi>ſorrow</hi> with a bleeding and melting hart, <note place="margin">3. In ſorrow.</note> as <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſalm. 51.

Elſe the confeſſion of ſinne is worſe then the ſinne confeſſed, the remedy is worſe then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and after ſuch confeſſions, wee had need to reconfeſſe our ſelues for our confeſſions.

But wee in our confeſſion muſt imitate that good <hi>Shecaniah,</hi> who in confeſſing ſinne entred into Couenant <note place="margin">Ezra. 10. 2. 3.</note> with the Lord againſt the ſinne confeſſed. <hi>We haue ſinned: now therefore let vs enter into couenant with the Lord.</hi> Otherwiſe confeſſion the remedy againſt ſin is turned into ſin.

So to too many of vs in the very ſelfe ſame dayes we confeſſe our ſins wee runne afreſh to our ſinnes. And God in his iuſt iudgement puniſhes hypocriticall confeſſion with a further greedineſſe of ſinning. When the heart is not rent with the garments, the rending of the garments ſowes the ſinne faſter together: when the heart and conſcience is not knocked together with the breſt, that knocking will neuer batter ſin, but conſolidate and compact it more firmely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <note place="margin">Tundens pertus, &amp; non corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens vitia, ea conſolidat.

                     <p>In the next place to <hi>Confeſsion</hi> wee muſt ioyne <note place="margin">2. In Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> 
                        <hi>Deprecation,</hi> with ſtrong cries crauing pardon, euen as the poore hunger-bitten begger does an almes, or as the caſt malefactour pleads for his life at the barre before the Iudge; Thus did <hi>Dauid, Haue mercy vpon me ô Lord, according to the multitude of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsions,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> &amp;c. And <hi>Daniel,</hi> O Lord heare, ô Lord <note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:197:44"/> forgiue, againe, and againe repeating his cries.</p>
                     <p>In theſe penitentiall prayers we may note theſe two things: Firſt, that they be deepely ſerious: the guilty theefe pleading for his life, goes not about to entertaine the Iudges eares with quaint phraſes and fine words, but he ſtudies to ſhew the paſſion and affection of his heart. There are ſome luſty beggars, that in begging will keepe a flouriſhing in their Rhetoricke, ſuch as it is. A wiſe man will neuer be moued to compaſſionate them: Hee will thinke they are not throughly hungerbitten, they would vſe another kind of dialect then, and leaue their fooleries, and fall to humble and pittiful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and groanes. As <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaies, <hi>The poore man ſpeaketh ſupplications;</hi> ſo the repenting ſinner <note place="margin">Prou. 18.</note> beeing poore in ſpirit, ſpeakes ſupplications. The beſt flowers he can garniſh his prayers with, are his ſighes, his ſobbes, his groanes, his cries. This is the Rhetoricke of repentance in prayer. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of carnall eloquence in prayer, ſhewes there is little repentance in ſuch praiers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That oftentimes affection in them is ſo ſtrong that wordes faile, Rom. 8. 26. <hi>Dauid</hi> when <hi>Nathan</hi> had wounded him cryed out, <hi>I haue ſinned.</hi> Why, will ſome ſay, did he not go on and craue pardon? his inward griefe was ſuch that hee could not in wordes: in deſire of heart hee did: his heart was full, and the ſeedes of the 51. Pſalme were then in his breaſt. So the Publicane ſaid no more but <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner,</hi> yet there was affection &amp; <note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> meditation enough to haue ſpent a whole day in prayer, and not onely to furniſh that one ſhort ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:197:44"/> Lord be mercifull. Some haue more words then matter in their prayers: but humbled repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants haue more matter then wordes: and ſo are ſtreighted, as great throngs of people preſſing out at ſome narrow paſſage ſticke faſt, and cannot goe forward but very ſlowly. Some are very ſhort in praier for want of matter and affection: but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinners are ſhort, becauſe of the aboundance of matter and affection; being as full veſſells that doe not runne preſently at the firſt piercing, or as the fleſh that in deeper wounds bleeds not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus was it with the repenting prodigall: he purpoſed to ſpeake thus, and thus to his Father, <note place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> Namely, Father I haue ſinned, &amp;c. make mee but as one of thy hired ſeruants. Now this laſt clauſe he leaues out when he comes to his Father, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon his heart was ſo ſurcharged with griefe; his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions drunke vp his ſpeech, as wee ſee how Chriſts teares made his ſpeech broken and imperfect, Luk. 19 41. And fit it is indeede there ſhould bee this ſweete harmony betwixt the repenting ſinners heart and tongue, his <hi>broken heart,</hi> and his <hi>broken prayers.</hi>

Repentance is the ſobriety of minde, but wordly pleaſures make the minde drunken. This is the heauineſſe ſpoken of <hi>Luc.</hi> 21. 34. <hi>Take heede leſt your hearts bee oppreſſed with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe.</hi> It is a <hi>drunken heauineſſe,</hi> not the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe of godly ſorrow.</hi> And indeed this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that many are ſo eager in the purſuits of their
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:197:46"/> pleaſures, becauſe they would make Gods Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, their owne conſcience, that purſues them drunken with theſe pleaſures: iuſt as many men vſe to doe, getting the Sergeant that comes to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt them into the Tauerne, and there making him drunke, that ſo they may eſcape. This exceſſe that is in pleaſures ſhewes how little men haue taſted of true humiliation. If they did bathe themſelues in ſalt teares could they bathe themſelues in this ſweet milke? If they did conſider what Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred for their ſinnes, his want of all theſe outward comforts, euen of an houſe to hide his head in, his hunger, thirſt, nakedneſſe, his vineger on the croſſe. Could they ſo fill and glut themſelues euen to ſatiety and ſurfet with the pleaſures of this life, and ſpend their whole precious time in them? would they not rather ſteepe their owne dainties in this vineger of godly ſorrow, and delay this ſtrong wine with this water, and eate their meats, as the Iewes their Paſſeouer, <hi>with ſowre hearbs?</hi> If <note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> their ſpirituall ioy in that Sacrament, where Chriſt was giuen to the Beleeuer, was to be ſeaſoned with this ſorrow, how much more ſhould this outward temporall ioy? Thus did <hi>Dauid</hi> notably expreſſe his humiliation: <hi>I cauſe my bed euery night to ſwimme,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 6. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>and water my couch with my teares:</hi> His bedde is the place of his eaſe. Now look how he qualefied that one eaſe, and comfort, ſo by proportion did he all the reſt. Not our beds onely, but our boords, our gardens, our fine buildings, all our delights muſt be waſhed with this water, as good <hi>Bradford</hi> vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at his dinner vſed to ſhed teares on his tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:197:47"/> So the woman <hi>Luc.</hi> 7. ſate weeping and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, while they were eating at table. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> makes his garden or place of pleaſure, to be a place of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> by building a ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher therein. Thus alſo doth <hi>Ieremie,</hi> bring in the repenting ſinner teſtifying his humiliation: <hi>He ſits</hi>

                        <hi>alone,</hi> retyring himſelfe into his cloſet from his vain and delightfull company, he ſhuts him vp himſelfe cloſe, and <hi>layes his mouth in the duſt,</hi> what then ſhall we ſay to our Epicures, to our good fellowes, and the reſt of that crue, but that of <hi>Amos</hi> 6. <hi>Woe bee to them that are at eaſe in Zion,</hi> not ſitting alone, not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing their beds with their teares, but with their quaffings and carowſings, <hi>They lie ſtretching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues on iuory beds, eating the lambs of the flocke, and the calues out of the ſtall, and ſing to the ſound of th violl.</hi> &amp;c. For as they forget <hi>Ioſephs affliction,</hi> ſo they forget their owne ſinnes: were they remembred, they would be ſowre ſawce to their ſweete meate, and would be as gall and wormewood to imbitter vnto them all their vaine delights.</p>

A little thing daunts ſuch a poore ſoule, whereas a man of ſpirit and courage will not be terrified with ones threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:197:47"/> Before our Repentance, oh the ſtoutneſſe and ſtiffeneſſe of our hearts againſt God! Though the Lyon roared neuer ſo much, wee would not tremble: but when with the hammer of the Law, and happily of ſome afflictions beſides, God hath broken theſe ſtout hearts of ours, then alas what a little thing will make vs ſtoope? An angry word, or an angry looke will more humble vs then, then angry ſtroakes and ſtripes could do before. Thus was it with broken heartd <hi>Ioſiah:</hi> he heard the book <note place="margin">2. Kin. 22. 10. 11.</note> of the Law onely read in a priuate place, by a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and yet his heart melted. Alas we heare the ſame threatnings not read onely but preached at large, with an edge ſet on them, in the open Church by Gods Miniſters, and yet wee tremble and relent no more then the ſeates wee ſit on, and the ſtones we tread on. So contrite <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when <note place="margin">Iſ. 39. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Iſaiah</hi> threatned him, he bowed, hee tooke not the boldneſſe and foole-hardineſſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> againſt <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah,</hi> and which many now take, to kicke againſt the Miniſter and his doctrine, and to ſay, It is not good which thou ſayeſt, as <hi>Ahab</hi> ſayd, but <hi>the word of the Lord,</hi> ſaies hee, <hi>is good.</hi> Thus was it with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ſo is it with all tender hearted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that when God hides his face, and looks but a little awry on them, then are they ſore troubled. So was it with humbled <hi>Iob, Behold</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>I am</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iob 39. 37. 38.</note> 
                        <hi>vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee, I will lay mine hand vpon my mouth, Once haue I ſpoken, but I will anſwer no more, yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</hi> So <hi>Ionah</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his repentance, by cloſing his Prophecy with <note place="margin">Ion 4.</note> his ſilence. But many are like thoſe impudent caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:197:48"/> at the laſt day, that will not ſticke to giue God the lie when hee rebukes them by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord</hi> (ſay they) <hi>when ſaw we thee an hungry, and ſed thee not?</hi> as if they had ſaid, why doeſt thou chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge vs of that wherof we were neuer guilty; and ſo they charge God to charge them falſely.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Humble patience</hi> in all our afflictions: I ſay <note place="margin">2. Humble Patience.</note> humble patience; for there is a threefold patience. 1. Conſtrained and perforce, when a man beares that which he would faine be rid, of, as the damned in hell. 2. Voluntary and cheerefull. But now one may ſuffer cheerefully when hee that afflicts deales vniuſtly. And this patience argues a vertue rather in the ſufferer, then any iuſtice in the infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the puniſhment. 3. There is therefore an <hi>humble patience,</hi> when a man acknowledges the righteouſnes of his afflictions in regard of his ſins: when a man frees and iuſtifies God, and blames himſelfe altogether.

                     <head>CHAP. IX. Of the contraries to Humiliation, Deſpaire and a ſeared Conſcience.</head>
                     <p>HItherto of the grace of Humiliation it ſelfe: Now to adde a worde or two of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to it. Contrary to godly humiliation or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are theſe two. 1. Deſperation. 2. The block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, the ſeared, and ſenceleſſe Conſcience <hi>that is paſt feeling.</hi> Both theſe indeed muſt be auoyded, but <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> yet the latter of the two is more vſuall, and more dangerous, more vſuall; becauſe it is more pleaſing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:197:50"/> to our nature, whereas Deſperation is more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtefull in regard of the bitterneſſe. And therfore Sathan wants that bait to bring men to deſpaire, which he hath to bring men to ſenſleſſe ſecurity. Therefore heere we may ſay, as they ſang of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid.</hi> Deſperation ſlayes <hi>thouſands,</hi> Security <note place="margin">Sam.</note> 
                        <hi>ten thouſands,</hi> euen as more die of intemperancy of diet, then are killed by the Sword: ſo though De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire be more <hi>fearefull,</hi> yet Security is more <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</hi> More dangerous alſo, becauſe Deſparation may be turned ſooner to good, for that the deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perſon is touched with the ſight of his ſins, &amp; feeles his owne miſery. But the ſenſleſſe conſcience is nothing ſo, it hath neither ſight of ſin, nor ſenſe of miſery.</p>
                     <p>Both theſe extreames of Deſperation and of Senſleſneſſe come from one cauſe, and that is, the neglect of the prickes and wounds of conſcience. It is a great mercy of God to giue vs ſo faire warning from a monitour within our owne boſomes. The warnings others giue vs, wee are ready to except againſt. Wee cannot except againſt the warnings of our owne hearts. But as when milder correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preuailes not with our children, wee proceed to ſeuerer diſcipline: ſo when Conſcience her gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler prickings are neglected, ſhee falles to deeper wounding and cutting; when rods will do no good, God puts Scorpions into her hands to ſcourge vs to death. Euery little prick of an accuſation fetches as it were ſome blood from thy ſoule; Now if pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently with a repenting heart thou wouldeſt craue the bloud of Chriſt to be applyed to thy ſoule, the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:197:50"/> bleeding would be ſtayed. But becauſe thou neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteſt the bleeding, and thinkeſt to ſtay it by baſe medicines of thine owne, therefore the wound bleedes ſtill, and thou ſhalt dye of it. And thus we ſee how deſperation comes from the neglect of the pricks of Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>But againe and that more commonly the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience growes ſeared, and paſt feeling, ſo that a man may now ſinne freely, and that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule of Conſcience, after that hee hath once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to deſpiſe the admonitions and accuſations thereof. So we ſee the Father giues ouer correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his vnhappy child, when hee growes worſe for all his correcting of him. Thus many mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences deale with them ſpeaking in a manner vnto them as God ſpeakes to the Iewes, <hi>Why ſhould</hi> we <hi>ſmite you any more, ſince ye fall away more and more?</hi> you ſet light by our warning, we will euen giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. <note place="margin">Iſay 1. 5.</note> Conſcience is Gods officer, and it is ſet by God to doe the beſt office that can bee to vs. But when God ſees his officer not regarded, hee will diſcharge him of his office. When a wound is not taken in time, the fleſh feſters, and growes dead and rotten: ſo alſo it fares with the wounds of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. A <hi>wounding Conſcience</hi> neglected will grow a <hi>dead Conſcience.</hi> O then howſoeuer thou mayſt ſet light by the checkes and rebukes of men, and mayſt ſhake off them. yet neuer reiect or con-contemne the checks of Conſcience. In any caſe take heed of that, for either it will continually ring ſuch a loud peale in thine eares as ſhall make them to tingle, and thine heart to tremble: or elſe that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:197:51"/> which is worſe, it ſhall for euer after hold its peace. Doe wee then feele the priuy nippes, and ſecret ſnibs, and pulls of our conſciences? Let vs giue ear to ſo wholſome a rebuker. Let vs ſeeke preſently to the Lord for mercy and forgiueneſſe. Let vs hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſoules before him in confeſſion. Let vs put Conſcience out of office no otherwiſe then thus, that as Conſcience hath accuſed vs to our ſelues, ſo now we will goe and accuſe our ſelues to our God. For if Conſciences roddes, and checks cannot driue thee to Repentance, whoſe ſhould? Many there are that in regard of their places are free from the rods, and the cheekes of men, as Kings, and great ones: Who dare checke them? None may ſmite them, yet God in mercy towards them will <note place="margin">2. Sam. 24. 10.</note> haue their Conſcience to ſmite them as <hi>Dauids heart ſmote him,</hi> though a King. Conſcience takes no notice of Kingſhip. Therefore all, euen great States, and they of all others muſt moſt liſten to, and heede the voice of Conſcience, leſt otherwiſe it fare with vs as with thoſe whom great and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent noiſes continually herd, at length make deafe, as in thoſe that dwell by the fall of the riuer <hi>Nilus.</hi> Or as it doth with vnlucky boyes, who beeing vſed to the rodde, at length harden themſelues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it not.</p>

                     <p>The firſt name is a metaphor drawen from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers, who hauing gone out of their way, muſt come backe againe and returne into the right way if euer they meane to arriue vnto the intended pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of their iourney. We all are or ſhould be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers to God, to Heauen-ward: but wee are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aſide into the quite contrary way: we are like the Prodigall departing from his fathers houſe, like the loſt ſheepe ſtraying from the fold: therefore we muſt turne backe againe, and ſet our faces to wards God, vpon whom wee haue turned our backes. It is impoſſible his feete ſhould euer ſtand in Heauen, whoſe eyes are not turned towards it. Men doe vainely perſwade themſelues of finding
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:197:52"/> God and his Kingdome with faces turned vpon ſinne, and backes vpon God. Excellently doth <hi>Iſay</hi> ioyne together <hi>turning</hi> and <hi>ſeeking God.</hi> A man <note place="margin">Iſ. 9. 13.</note> may long enough ſeeke an Eaſterne Countrey in the Weſt, ere he finde it. And as long may hee ſeeke God in the wayes of ſinne and Sathan, ere he ſhall meet with him. This phraſe then ſheweth the abſolute neceſſity of Repentance: for as he whoſe backe being turned vpon me is gone farre from me can neuer be with me, vnleſſe he turne his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and ſo make towards me with his feete: no more can wee ſinners that are gone away from the Lord euer enioy him, or bee with him, vnleſſe by Repentance we turne towards him: onely thus turning may wee ſeeke him, and thus ſeeking can we finde him.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond name is <hi>Metanoia, After-wit,</hi> or <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-wiſdome,</hi> oppoſed to <hi>Pronoia, Fore-wit,</hi> fore-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and prouiding before hand.</p>

                     <p>THe ſecond poynt to bee conſidered in this <note place="margin">2. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it. where</note> Change or Turning, is the <hi>nature</hi> thereof, and that is ſet downe in the definition to be a turning from ſinne to God.</p>
                     <p>Heere though the nature of it be ſet foorth by a metaphor drawen from change of place, yet indeed Repentance is no change of place, but of qualities, manners and diſpoſitions from <hi>Euill</hi> to <hi>Good.</hi> The ſoule and body in regard of their eſſence, powers, faculties, and proper and naturall actions remaine the ſame after Repentance that before. Onely the corrupt and vicious qualities in them are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. and ſo they are rectified. Sorrow, feare, ioy, &amp;c. are not aboliſhed, but onely poliſhed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined of that droſſe of errour in regard of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. Feare of puniſhment is turned into feare of ſinne, and worldly ſorrow into godly, Carnall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:197:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> mirth into ſpirituall ioy in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Againe this change is twofold. 1. <hi>Paſsiue,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God changes and turnes vs. In the which wee are meere patients, and God onely workes. 2. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue,</hi> whereby wee being turned and changed by God, doe labour further to turne and change our ſelues. Both theſe in time are together, but yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in nature. The former is that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and is as it were the infuſing of a ſoule into a dead body. The latter is Repentance, and is the motion or ſtirring of the ſoule infuſed. Of it <hi>Iohn,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>He that hath this hope pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth</hi>

                        <hi>himſelfe.</hi> And this latter actiue Conuerſion in Repentance, is the effect of the former paſſiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion. <hi>After I was conuerted I repented:</hi> ſo <hi>Iſay</hi> 30. <note place="margin">Ierem. 31. 18.</note> 21. 22. And in this regard is Repentance made the gift of God, becauſe his turning of vs, is the cauſe of our turning our ſelues.</p>
                     <p>For the vnderſtanding of the nature of this tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning two things muſt be conſidered. 1. The <hi>Parts.</hi> 2. The <hi>Properties</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Parts are two. 1. <hi>Auerſion</hi> from ſinne. <note place="margin">1. The parts which are</note> 2. <hi>Conuerſion</hi> to God.</p>
                     <p>For the former; It was thus expreſſed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, <note place="margin">1. Auerſion from ſinne.</note> Repentance is a grace, &amp;c. whereby the ſinner &amp;c. turnes from his ſinne: where let vs mark that Repentance is made a turning from ſinne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely without reſtriction: whence ariſe thoſe two Conſectaries. 1. That there is no ſinne ſo great but <hi>may be;</hi> And 2. That there is no ſinne ſo ſmall, but <hi>muſt be</hi> oppoſed and encountred with Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Reaſon ſayes, Great ſinnes cannot be: and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:197:54"/> ſmall ſinnes need not be repented of. In great ſins Reaſon derogates from Gods mercy; as though they could not bee pardoned for all our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: <hi>My ſinne is greater then can be forgiuen.</hi> In leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> from his iuſtice and truth; as though they might be pardoned without any Repentance at all. Againſt both theſe errours oppoſe wee both theſe aſſertions, and thus doe we maintaine them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I ſay; There is no ſinne ſo hainous or hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but there is place for Repentance, the ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt alwayes reſerued: of which it is ſayd, that it is <hi>impoſsible</hi> that euer the offendors therein ſhould be <hi>renewed by Repentance.</hi> Not that <note place="margin">Hebr. 6.</note> the Arme of Gods power is ſhortned, or the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of his mercy ſo ſtraightned, as though any ſinne could ouercome either: but as of a Phyſician though otherwiſe able, and willing to heale a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, it may be ſayd yet, hee cannot heale him, if he bee obſtinately wilfull, and will neither endure the Phyſician, but ſpits in his face, nor his Phyſick, but ſpils it on the ground; euen ſo the caſe is here. Therefore cannot this ſinne be pardoned, this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall diſeaſe be cured, becauſe this is the nature of it, to rage and raue deſperatly both againſt the phyſicke, and againſt the Phyſician; to trample <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29.</note> the bloud of Chriſt vnder feet, and to deſpight the ſpirit of God the ſprinckler of this bloud, and not to endure him, when he perſwades to prepare the heart to Repentance, for the receit of that Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne medicines.</p>
                     <p>But as for all other ſinne; Chriſt ſayes, <hi>I came to call ſinners</hi> (without exception) <hi>to Repentance,</hi>

                     <p>This is to comfort ſuch whom the multitude and hainouſneſſe of their ſinnes diſcourages, as though there were no acceſſe to mercy by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Vnto theſe God ſayes, <hi>Come, let vs reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:</hi>

And if thy ſinne bee ſo great as thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt, what meaneſt thou to make it greater by not repenting. The greatneſſe of thy ſinne trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thee. Repentance will make it leſſe: it is only impenitency that is the condemning ſinne. O but the greatneſſe of my ſinne hinders me from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: ſay not ſo: Remember that Chriſt is thy phyſician, and Repentance is his phyſicke, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>The whole neede not a Phyſician,</hi> but the ſicke; I came

Indeed bodily diſeaſes ſometimes ſo weaken that there is no ability to receiue, much leſſe the power in the phyſicke receiued to worke. Many diſeaſes are there that poſe the beſt Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <note place="margin">Ludibria Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicorum.</note> and are their ſhame and reproch: not ſo here: Neuer art thou ſo low brought, but Chriſt is able to make thee take his receit of Repentance: and when it is once taken, neuer doubt of the working: for there is no ſinne, no ſpirituall diſeaſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes the skill of our ſpirituall Phyſician, Ieſus Chriſt. And therfore ſo many examples we haue of horrible ſinners renewed by Repentance, as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> an Harlot, <hi>Abraham</hi> an Idolater, <hi>Manaſſes</hi> a Tyrant, <hi>Paul</hi> a Perſecutour, thoſe Magicians called at the birth, that debauched theefe called at the death of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>This doctrine condemneth the rigour of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatians</hi> denying Repentance to them that fell away through feare in time of perſecution.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 Chriſt commands vs to forgiue our brother vnto 70. times 7. times in one day, if hee repent. Now that which God bids vs doe, in ſome meaſure <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 22.</note> we doe it: and that good which we doe, and haue, we haue it from God, and doe it by his helpe. All our goodneſſe and mercy is but a little particle out of his fulneſſe, a drop out of his Sea. Therefore if there be ſuch mercy in vs to forgiue thoſe that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their repentance for ſome iniuries done vs, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againe in the ſame kind, much more then in God the Father, and fountaine of mercies.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Neither want wee altogether example of Scripture. <hi>Abrahams</hi> example, Gen. 12. 19. hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his wiues chaſtity by a ſlippery pollicie: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, Geneſis. 20. 2. daſhing his foote at the ſame ſtone is alleaged by ſome. To the which wee may alſo adde that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> worſhipping the Angell the ſecond time, after the Angells rebuke for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer errour. But in theſe examples there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of repentance after the firſt ſlip. Though
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:197:56"/> in all likelihood the rebuke of an Angell ſhould preuaile with <hi>Iohn,</hi> and of a heathen man with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> ſpecially when hee ſaw Gods rebuke in the the danger he was in. Beſides that theſe ſeeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee examples of <hi>infirmities,</hi> then of <hi>more grieuous offences,</hi> whereof the queſtion is made. As for <hi>Peters</hi> diſſimulation in his Iudaizing, Gal. 2. it was nothing of that nature that his diſſimulation was in denying Chriſt. And therefore it cannot be counted ſuch a Relapſe as now we ſpeake of. The example of <hi>Ionas</hi> ſeemes fitter for this purpoſe: his ſinne was grieuous to runne away from God, and forſake his ambaſſage to Niniueh: and for it being grieuouſly puniſhed in the whales belly, hee there heartily repented, as appeares, Ionas. 2. yet for all this when God ſpared Niniueh, he was angry with him, and iuſtified his former ſinne, and wiſhed hee had neuer come thither; which in effect, and before <note place="margin">Ionas 4. 1. 2.</note> God was all one as to haue committed that ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the ſecond time. Heere is comfort then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for relapſed perſons, that are intangled againe in the ſame offences whereout formerly they were deliuered by repentance. And yet this comfort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs onely to poore troubled conſciences, not to preſumptuous ſinners. It is not to encourage any that ſtands to fall, or that is fallen to lye ſtill, but onely him that is fallen, and feeles himſelfe fallen, and begins to deſpaire of recouery, to ſtriue to get vp on foote, by putting him in hope of a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of riſing vp againe by helpe of that <hi>ſtone which is</hi>

                     <p>But as for leſſer ſlippes, whoſe experience doth not tell him that euen after repentance he is again, and againe hampered in the ſame ſnares of anger, techineſſe, luſt, negligence, ſecret pride, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, vaine-glory, &amp;c. Though yet the fruit of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repentance before will appeare in our falling againe, that we ſhall preſently catch our ſelues tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Therefore we muſt not be ouer much perplex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed in ſuch caſes, to thinke our former repentance vnſound. For repentance doth not wholly take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſinne, but onely weakens it, leſſens, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payres it. And as he truely runned who afterward ſitteth downe: ſo hee may truely repent of ſome ſin who afterward is foyled by it againe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Conſectary is, that there is no ſinne ſo ſmall but it needes repentance. The world thinkes that repentance is onely for more grieuous ſinnes, as murther adultery, oppreſſion, blaſphemy: as for leſſer matters they hope they may bee diſpenſed withall. Heere our ciuill men are to bee nipped, who put away repentance from themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe free from groſſe ſcandall. Surely, though they had no vnbeleefe or prophaneneſſe of heart, which indeede are as heynous ſinnes as any, yet haue they cauſe enough to repent, if it were but for the very leaſt idle thoughts, or wordes they euer thought or ſpoke. The children of GOD whoſe heart God hath ſoftned by the touch of his ſpirit, will be troubled euen for the leaſt ſinnes; account ting no ſinne little which is committed againſt ſo great a God. <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> that good <hi>Martyr</hi> in his <note place="margin">Foxe Martyrol. in Epiſt.

But here is the very pith of repentance, <hi>The turning of the heart vpward to Heauen,</hi> and fixing the eye vpon God, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards him with the foote: that ſo it may be ſaid of euery true repentant, that his behauiour is as of one that is going vp to the <hi>heauenly Ieruſalem,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luke 9.</note> as it was ſaide of Chriſt going to the <hi>earthly Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Oh this one thing ſhowes how little repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance there is in this world, when the ſhame of our affections carries vs downeward to the earth. A plaine argument the heart is turned to God: For in this regard a Chriſtians <hi>conuerſation is in heauen,</hi> becauſe by repentance his eye is now turned to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and his feete are carrying him thether apace. <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This then miniſters exceeding great comfort to the poore repenting ſinner diſcouraged with his manifold ſlippes and infirmities, and is brought to doubt of the truth of his repentance by the ſenſe of his many and daily frailties. Such an one may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that repentance conſiſts in a turning of the heart and affections to God, not in walking in a way without a ſtumbling foote. Repentance takes not away ſtumbling, it takes not away ſlipping, and ſliding of the foote. It keepes the <hi>face</hi> from tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from God, and the <hi>foote</hi> from walking from God. It fares with a repentant as with a man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:197:58"/> vp an hill, who though he may haue many fals and ſlippes, yet ſtill is ſaid to bee going vp the hill, becauſe his face is toward the toppe of the hill. So it is with the penitent ſinner, he is turning to God, though he haue many falls, becauſe his face is ſet, and the maine current of his affections is bent vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God. This therefore be thy comfort, thou wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt not out to meete and to welcome ſinne, but it came vpon thee at vnawares, and like a coward comming behind thee ſtrooke vp thine heeles, thy feet indeed ſlid a little downeward, but thy face was ſtill vpward.</p>
                     <p>But the maine point that heere is to bee inſiſted vpon, is this, that repentance alwaies brings with it a wonderfull, and a palpable change and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart and life. When our affections, like wilde madde horſes are violently galloping to hell, the ſpirit of God by repentance, as by a bridle, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly giues a ierke and turnes them, and ſets them a going as faſt the other way. So that thoſe our companions in the broad way ſtand maruelling at vs, that wee breake off company, and doe not ſtill continue <hi>running out with them into the ſame exceſſe of ryot.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4 4.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>So great is the change that not onely our ſelues, but others alſo may diſcerne it as to maruell at it. It is compared to the change of darkeneſſe into <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 8.</note> light, which who ſees it not? yea vnto the change of a ſtone into fleſh, <hi>I will take away the ſtony heart, and giue you a heart of fleſh.</hi> Why doth Sathan bid <note place="margin">Ezek. 26. 26.</note> Chriſt turne ſtones into bread to prooue himſelfe God? Hee had long before done a greater matter
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:197:58"/> then that, euen turned ſtones into fleſh which is ſofter then bread. Great and wonderfull is that change of glory in the life to come, when a peece of clay ſhall ſhine as the Sunne, when corruption ſhall put on incorruption, when theſe baſe earthly bodies ſhall bee ſpirituall bodies, and theſe weake ignorant ſoules ſhall become like the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. But this change which is wrought by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in the conuerſion of a ſinner farre excels it: For the diſtance betwixt <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> is not ſo great as betwixt <hi>Sinne</hi> and <hi>grace:</hi> for grace is the beginning of glory. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> couches <hi>Sanctification</hi> vnder <hi>Glorification,</hi> being but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>Sanctification:</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> cals the <hi>Grace</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>of ioy, glorious ioy and vnſpeakable.</hi> But ſin is flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 8.</note> to grace, and a change from one <hi>degree</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, is eaſier then from one <hi>kinde</hi> to another. No maruell then if the Angels doe ſo triumph at the Repentance of a ſinner, when they ſee a greater <note place="margin">Luc. 15. 10.</note> change then that at the firſt creation, when out of that deformed and confuſed <hi>Chaos,</hi> ſo good and ſo bewtifull a creature as heauen &amp; earth was drawn.

                     <p>Heere then is an excellent triall of our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Let vs not deceiue our ſelues.

Canſt thou with good conſcience ſay, I was thus and thus, but now the caſe is altered, I hate that folly which before I loued, I embrace that grace of God which before, ſwine that I was, I trampled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my feete. Thou muſt be able to ſay ſo before thou canſt bee able to ſay thou haſt repented. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Continuance</hi> in thine old wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes cannot ſtand together. Repentance will make thee of an earthling, a ſaintling, of fierce, meeke, of couetous, bountifull, of fleſhly, ſpirituall, of a wolfe, a ſheepe, yea of a <hi>Diuell,</hi> an <hi>Angell.</hi> So that thou maiſt ſay, I was an vncleane beaſt; but doe I follow drinking ſtill? So <hi>Paul; Doe I yet ſeeke to pleaſe men?</hi> as who ſhould ſay, it is time: Indeede <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 10. explaned.</note> once I did ſeeke to pleaſe men, but I am now other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then I was. So to the Corinthians, <hi>Yea though wee haue knowne Christ after the fleſh heeretofore,</hi> deſpiſing him for want of outward glory, <hi>yet now henceforth know him ſo no more.</hi> But alas, alas, no <note place="margin">2.

How many ciuil men haue wee, that remaine in their pure naturalls, and bleſſe themſelues in their outward honeſty and glory in this, that they were alwaies the ſame, which is iuſt to <hi>glory in their ſhame.</hi> For what is it elſe but a plaine profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that they neuer had any repentance: for that would haue made a ſtrange alreration.

A thing indeed which ciuill men can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be brought vnto, to demoliſh and caſt down the goodly buildings (as they thinke, though indeed rotten and ruinous) of their ciuill vertues: they can hardly endure to haue all their life by-paſt cenſured and condemned for nought.

And theſe our times want not ſuch examples, when ciuill men hauing beene cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed vpon by the ſpirit, they haue ſeene their owne dangerous ſtate, and haue beene vrged to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſo haue felt a wonderfull change in their harts and liues: of neglecters of the word and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they haue become conſcionable practiſers of all religious dueties, and zealous louers of that which before onely faſhionably, and for Lawes ſake they haue performed.</p>
                     <p>Let then ciuill men whoſe nature is changed by the ſpirit of Repentance, know that they are in a damnable ſtate, and that it will not bee well with them, till they grow to a loathing, and a deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

By the two former whereof wee ſhall terrifie the firſt kinde of ſelfe-deceiuers, and by the third ſhall comfort the ſecond kind of doubters.</p>
                     <p>1. Properly. This change then muſt be an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly change, beginning in the ſoule, euen in the <note place="margin">1. It is orderly</note> very marrow and ſpirit thereof, and ſo proceeding to the outward man, and the actions thereof. This orderly change the Apoſtle teacheth when firſt he bids vs <hi>be renued in the ſpirits of our mindes,</hi> and then <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 23. 24</note> 
                        <hi>let him that ſtole ſteale no more. O Ieruſalem waſh thine</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ieremy 4.</note> 
                        <hi>heart.</hi> But alas how many are there that ſet the cart before the horſe, and begin to change their liues before their hearts. Some indeede aduiſe vs ſo to doe, but as I thinke not aduiſedly. It is the onely
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:197:61"/> way to hypocriſie to doe that outwardly which is not firſt begunne in wardly. And beſides it is idle, and to no purpoſe to purge the channell when the fountaine is corrupt, and to apply remedies to the head, when the headach is cauſed from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſtomacke. Miſerable experience ſhewes how ſuch diſordered beginnings of Repentance of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten come to a miſerable end. Content not then thy ſelfe with leauing ſinne outwardly, but ſee you loath it inwardly, content not thy ſelfe to loppe off the boughes, but lay the axe to the roote of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>2. Properly. It muſt be a thorough change. <hi>The</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. It is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord ſanctifie you</hi> throughout, <hi>that your</hi> whole <hi>ſpirit and ſoule and body may bee blameleſſe.</hi> Many in their repentance giue but the halfe turne, Acts 1. thoſe <note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5. 23.</note> that turne from one ſinne to another, as from coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe to prodigality, from Atheiſme, or Iuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, to Popery. This is as if the mouſe eſcaping the trappe, ſhould fall into the pawes of the cat. It is iuſt like the turning of the wind from one point of the North vnto the other, from North-eaſt to North-weſt, but yet ſtill it is in the North, and as far from the South as before. So theſe men turne, but yet in their ſinne ſtill, and as farre from God as before. Secondly, thoſe that turne their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings from errour to truth, but not their wills from euill to good, as thoſe that of Papiſts turne looſe and vnreformed Proteſtants. Thirdly, thoſe that turne from many ſinnes and with <hi>Herod</hi> doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, but yet they remaine vnturned from ſome one ſpeciall ſinne. Some indeede there are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:197:62"/> whoſe change makes them like Aethiopians, white onely <hi>in teeth,</hi> euery where elſe cole-black. I meane our verball profeſſours that haue onely a change from the teeth outward, a change of their wordes, can ſpeake well, and that is all. But others there are that goe further, and doe much, and yet not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, becauſe though they ſeeme to turne from ſinne, and to looke towards God, yet haue a lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring eye, and a ſquint reſpect vnto their ſins, with <hi>Lots</hi> wife caſting a longing looke after their olde <hi>Sodome.</hi> And they turne, as if a man whoſe face is towards the Weſt, ſhould turne to the North, or South: for ſo turning hee may looke both waies, both to the Weſt whereon his face was ſet, and to the Eaſt whereon his backe was turned. So many turne from their ſinnes to God, not directly, but ſide-waies, ſo that with one eye they may looke to God, and with the other to ſome ſinne. But as hee whoſe face is turned directly to the Eaſt cannot ſee the Weſt, ſo he who indeed looks directly to God, cannot looke to his ſinnes, but he muſt needs haue them behind his backe. Repentance if it be true, is generall: It ſtrippes vs ſtarke naked of all the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and leaues not ſo much as the ſhirt behind. In this rotten building it leaues not a <hi>ſtone vpon a ſtone.</hi> As the flood drowned <hi>Noahs</hi> owne friends and ſeruants, ſo muſt the floud of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting teares drowne euen our ſweeteſt and moſt profitable ſinnes. Moſt true is that ſaying of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas, That all ſinnes are coupled together, though not in regard of conuerſion to temporall good, for ſome looke to the good of gaine, ſome of glory, ſome</hi>
                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:197:62"/> 
                        <hi>of pleaſure, &amp;c. Yet in regard of</hi> auerſion from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good, <hi>that is God.</hi> So that hee that lookes but toward one ſinne, is as much auerted and turned backe from God, as if he looked to all. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſayes, he that offends in one, is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all. Repentance is a thorough change of the whole man, of the whole life: it refines euery part, not ſo much but vanity and lightneſſe in apparell. <hi>The Lord ſhall waſh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah) the filthines of the daughters of Zion,</hi> that is, that proud brauery, and affected meanes of apparell mentioned in the third <note place="margin">Iſay 4. 4. opened.</note> chapter, <hi>by the ſpirit of iudgement,</hi> that is of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whereby they ſhall iudge themſelues for that ſinne, and condemne that for <hi>naſtineſſe</hi> which before they accounted <hi>neateneſſe,</hi> and that for <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,</hi> which before they accounted <hi>fineneſse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Property. It is yet an vnperfect change. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it is in regard of <hi>parts,</hi> as a childe is a perfect <note place="margin">3. It is vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> man, but imperfect in <hi>degrees.</hi> It is like the change of the ayre from darke to light in the dawning of the day, which proceedes by degrees, or as the change and turning of water from could to hot, which is firſt luke-warme. This I note for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſuch poore ſoules, that when they heare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is ſuch a change of the minde, and feele ſo little change in themſelues, but their olde ſinnes to be ſo ſtrong and liuely, are driuen to doubts. But for their comforte they muſt know that this is a <hi>change,</hi> that with greefe they feele, and complaine euen of thoſe ſecret infirmities which were wont neuer to trouble them. The riſing of the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne, the antipathy, and ſecret grudging,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:197:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> and murmuring of the ſpirit againſt it, euen then when it is foyled by it, is an argument of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed change begunne, which ſhall bee perfected in time.</p>

                        <hi>this thing that yee haue beene godly ſorry, what great care it hath wrought in you, yea what cleering of your ſelues, yea what indignation, yea what feare, yea how great deſire, yea what a zeale, yea what puniſhment. &amp;c</hi> He had ſaid before <hi>Godly ſorrow workes repentance,</hi> that is, this ſecond part of repentance, <hi>the change of the minde,</hi> for godly ſorrow as wee haue ſeene is the firſt part. Now heere hee prooues that godly ſorrow workes repentance, and his reaſon ſtandeth thus. That which workes care and cleering, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, &amp;c. that workes repentance: but godly ſorrow workes theſe things, therefore it workes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. So that it is plaine that the Apoſtle here referreth thoſe things to the practiſe of this ſecond
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:197:63"/> part. To come then vnto the particular duties.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Duety is <hi>Care.</hi> Now this <hi>care</hi> is twofold: firſt <note place="margin">1. Care.</note> the maine <hi>care</hi> whereby a ſinner takes thought for the remiſſion of his ſinnes, and life eternall. Such was the <hi>care</hi> of thoſe after they were pricked in their hearts at <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon when they crie out, <note place="margin">Acts 2 37.</note> 
                        <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall wee doe?</hi> The voice of men in <hi>care</hi> &amp; anxiety, as of thoſe that are in great <hi>care</hi> for this world: <hi>what ſhall wee eat? or what ſhall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>we drinke? or what ſhall we put on?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is that which is figured in the Parable of the vniuſt ſteward, who is brought in conſulting and taking care, <hi>what ſhall I doe? digge I cannot, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luke 16. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>to begge I am aſhamed.</hi> So that the firſt beginning of our turning to the Lord is a ſerious, and a <hi>thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conſultation</hi> what courſe to take for the pardon of our ſinnes, and the ſaluation of our ſoules.</p>
                     <p>Now in this carefull conſultation there are two things to be conſidered. 1. the ground. 2. the end of it.</p>
                     <p>For the ground of it. It is the ſight and certaine knowledge of the errour of our former courſe of life, and the iuſt cenſure and condemnation of it. As when a man turnes him to the right way, firſt he ſees plainely, and concludes that he is gone wrong and thereupon bethinks himſelfe <hi>what to doe,</hi> that he may recouer the right way againe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The end or effect of it, it ends alwaies in true repentants in a ſetled <hi>determination,</hi> and reſolute purpoſe to enter into that good way which the word of God diſcouers vnto them for good. Some indeede deliberate and conſult, but they remaine
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:197:64"/> houering, and do not reſolue: like faint chap-men, that cheapen and hancker about wares, but will not come off. They are loath to ſell all they haue, to purchaſe the pearle, to buy heauen with the loſſe of their ſinnes. For when Sathan ſees a man beginne to miſtruſt his owne courſes, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thoughts of departing out of Aegypt, he vſes all the craft he can to detaine him, and purſues after him departing, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> after the <hi>Iſralites.</hi> So in the Goſpell, the dumbe and deafe Diuell, when Chriſt came to diſpoſſeſſe him, raged and tooke on. So that euery Chriſtian in the practiſe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before he can paſſe from his <hi>conſultation</hi> to a <hi>reſolution</hi> and <hi>determination,</hi> he ſhall finde and feele a ſhrewd bickering and conflict both with Sathan and the fleſh, that will labour him to continue in his ſinnes ſtill, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his confeſſions ſhewes it was with him in his conuerſion. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the temptations of Sathan &amp; the fleſh, the Chriſtian gets the victory, and growes to a <hi>reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</hi> This <hi>purpoſe</hi> and <hi>reſolution</hi> of the heart, is the very hart of Repentance. <hi>I haue</hi> determined <hi>to keepe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 57.</note> 
                        <hi>thy word,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dauid.</hi> And this is that which <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> exhorted the <hi>Antiochians, that with</hi> purpoſe of heart <hi>they would cleaue vnto the Lord.</hi> And thus is <note place="margin">Acts 11. 23.</note> the Prodigall ſonne brought in <hi>reſoluing</hi> with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>I will goe to my father and ſay,</hi> &amp;c. and when he <note place="margin">Luc. 15. 18.</note> did but thus <hi>reſolue,</hi> his father came foorth to meet him: for this ſerious purpoſe to turne, is turning: <hi>I thought I will confeſſe, and thou forgaueſt me.</hi> So when <note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Zaccheus</hi> had but <hi>reſolued</hi> to make reſtitution, when as yet he had not done it, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Saluation was</hi>

                        <hi>come into his houſe.</hi> If wee haue not this conſtant purpoſe of heart to forſake all our ſinnes, and to endeauour our ſelues to the obedience of Gods commandements, we haue not yet ſet one foot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the threſhold of Repentance. The Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> calling vpon <hi>Iſrael</hi> to returne, they are brought in anſwering the Lord, <hi>Behold wee come</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 3. 22.</note>

                        <hi>way of thy commandements.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> bids the Iewes to <hi>waſh them, and to make them cleane, to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſ. 1. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>ceaſe to doe euill, and to learne to doe well,</hi> &amp;c. Now it might bee ſayd, Alas theſe are hard matters, how ſhall we be able to doe all this? The Prophet ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore qualifies the matter, ſaying, <hi>If yee conſent and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">verſe 19.</note> 
                        <hi>obey,</hi> that is, If ye conſent to obedience in the ſound and ſerious purpoſes and thoughts of your hearts, <hi>ye ſhall eat the good things of the Land.</hi> Though you cannot ſo thoroughly waſh you, yet conſent to it, and agree to it, and it ſhall be accepted.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond <hi>Care</hi> followes vpon this purpoſe, the former <hi>Care</hi> ended: when a man hath purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſet downe with himſelfe to do ought, then he takes <hi>Care</hi> how to bring this purpoſe to paſſe. The Repentant conſiders with himſelfe that though now he be turned into the right way, yet
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:197:65"/> if he haue not his eyes in his head, hee may eaſily loſe it againe. Hee is not ignorant how many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments will encounter him in the way, how many ſtumbling blockes will bee layd by Sathan, beſides that the olde Sepent will be behinde him nibbling at his heeles, and aſſaying him to plucke him backe. Now then theſe thoughts runne in his head, I haue reſolued to enter into this courſe, alas how ſhall I be able to goe thorough it? like the wiſe <note place="margin">Luc. 14.</note> builder he caſts his accounts afore hand, conſiders the weightineſſe of Chriſtianity, and bethinkes himſelfe how hee ſhall bee able to performe that which he hath vndertaken. He obiects to himſelfe reſoluing to ſerue God, as once <hi>Ioſhua</hi> to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaying, <hi>We will ſerue the Lord, Nay but yee cannot ſerue the Lord, for he is an holy God, hee is a iealous God,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioſh 24 28. 19.</note> &amp;c. So our Repentant in his firſt turning informs himſelfe of the great difficulties, that are in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in that way, whereinto his feet are turning. He conſiders that he is raiſed out of the graue of ſinne, but yet like <hi>Lazarus</hi> bound with napkins, ſo <note place="margin">Ioh. 11.</note> is he ſtill hampered with the bonds of many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, wich will quickely make him weary and faint. And therefore now all his <hi>care</hi> is, how hee may hold out, and compaſſe that which hee hath propounded to himſelfe. Now this ſecond <hi>Care</hi> he ſhewes in the practiſe of theſe duties.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe he knowes that in this building there are many enemies, as once in the building of the wals of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> hee therefore ſhewes his <hi>Care</hi> in <note place="margin">Nehem. 4</note> furniſhing himſelfe with ſpirituall weapons wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with one hand, and holding the ſword of the

                     <p n="2">2. Being thus armed and prouided, hee hath a vigilant and a watchfull eye againſt all occaſions and meanes of ſinne, and hath a <hi>Care</hi> to auoyde them.

                     <p n="3">3. Hee is <hi>carefull</hi> to doe all good duties both in his generall, and in his ſpeciall calling, as to pray, reade, meditate, inſtruct, admoniſh. <hi>Heare ô Iſrael,</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. He is <hi>carefull</hi> to doe them in that holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which God requires. Hee is not ignorant of Sathans wilineſſe, how he labours to intereſt and inſinuate himſelfe into our beſt actions. Heere then is his <hi>Care</hi> that he goe with an euen foot, and an vpright heart not out of a deſire to bee ſeene of men, and to haue praiſe from them. <hi>Take heed</hi> how <hi>you giue your almes.</hi> He obſerues not onely that hee doe, but <hi>how</hi> he doth good duties.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Hee is <hi>carefull</hi> to apprehend all occaſions of Good whatſoeuer are offered: hee markes when God ſends ſuch men vnto him, of whom hee may receiue further comfort and knowledge: hee alſo markes when God puts ſuch into his hands, to whom hee may performe any good office, and withall hee markes the ſeaſon and opportunity. When any accident of Gods ſpeciall workes, either of mercy or iudgement fals out in the world, hee
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:197:66"/> makes good vſe of it: as the Lord noted how <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> vppon occaſion of his iudgement on <hi>Sodom,</hi>

                     <p>By this now may we trye our ſelues whether we repent or no. Repentance we ſee is a very carefull thing, &amp; fills our heads with many ſerious thoughts in things ſpirituall.

And as we looke not backe to ſay, <hi>what haue I done?</hi> ſo neither looke we forward to ſay <hi>what ſhall we doe.</hi> Now we walk raſhly, hand ouerhead.

                     <p>And heere we may obſerue a notable difference betweene the repentant ſinner, and the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The wicked wretch ſo he can ſhift off by any meanes the <hi>accuſation,</hi> hee neuer cares nor labours for the Iudges <hi>abſolution,</hi> who in his time will take notice of his ſinne, though neuer any accuſation ſhould be profered.

Where is thy <hi>defence,</hi> thy protection againſt him? Alas, thou haſt prouided none. Now the true repentant he conſiders that it is to no purpoſe to put away the accuſer, when as yet the iudge remaines vnpacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who will againe, and againe ſet this accuſer on our backes till we haue pacified him. And therfore his chiefe dealing is with the iudge himſelfe, to get his fauour and grace, and ſo hee getting the Iudges <hi>abſolution,</hi> regards not a whit the officers accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In a worde, the wicked when Conſcience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, haue no other care then to ſtop the mouth of Conſcience, and to choake it for the preſent that it may not accuſe. The godly further, as they would not haue it accuſe, ſo neyther further would they haue it a ſilent and a ſenceleſſe Conſcience, but they would turne accuſing conſcience, into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing and <hi>clearing</hi> Conſcience.

                     <p>Now this <hi>feare</hi> is of excellent vſe in the practiſe of Repentance, for it is as a bridle to order, guide and keepe vs in the way whereinto Repentance <note place="margin">Prou. 28. 14.</note> turnes our feet. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwaies, but he</hi> that in deſperate boldneſſe <hi>hardens his heart, ſhall ſurely fall into euill.</hi> Therefore by the force of the oppoſition he implies, that he that feares ſhall be kept from euill, and that heerein his bleſſedneſſe conſiſteth, which he more plainly auouches elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>The feare of the Lord is a well-ſpring of life to</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, when ſtrong and violent tentations aſſault vs, it ſtrengthens vs, and withholds our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for the repenting ſinner being now turned to God, he alwayes ſees God, and knowes that God ſees him, and therefore the awefull reuerence hee carries to his preſence reſtraines him.

                     <p>Thirdly, it keepes from ſuch ſinnes, where the feare of man reſtraines not, euen from ſecret and vnknowen ſinnes to the world. <hi>Thou ſhalt not,</hi> ſaith <note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 14.</note> the Lord, curſe the deafe: why, what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? he cannot heare vs if we doe, <hi>Thou ſhalt not lay a ſtumbling blocke before the blinde:</hi> why, what ſhould let vs? hee cannot ſee vs if wee doe. Marke the words following, <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord,</hi> who both heares thy curſes, and ſees thy ſtumbling blockes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In the whole courſe of our life it makes vs <hi>worke out our ſaluation with fearing and trembling,</hi> euen <hi>reioycing in feare,</hi> and <hi>feaſting in feare,</hi> knowing <note place="margin">Phil. 2.

                     <p>In theſe and ſuch like reſpects is this feare ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the practiſe of repentance: for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a continuall returning towards God, and drawing neerer ſtill to him. To the which how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer that helliſh and ſlauiſh feare bee a let, for it driues a man backe from God, and turnes away the face from ſinne, yet not this louing and filiall feare, for it driues from ſinne, and keepes vs from forſaking God, <hi>I will put my feare,</hi> ſayes the Lord, <note place="margin">Ier. 32. 40.</note>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:197:70"/> 
                        <hi>in their hearts that they ſhall not depart from mee.</hi> Out of this feare ariſes that notable duety which ſome Repentants in the more ſerious exerciſe of their Repentance, in the Scriptures, haue practiſed. Namely, that entring into Couenant with God, &amp; binding our ſelues by ſolemne oath vnto him. This was <hi>Dauids</hi> practiſe, <hi>I haue ſworne, and I will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous iudgements.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 106.</note> The ſame duty we finde practiſed in the bookes of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> Now this practiſe ariſes out <note place="margin">Ezr 10. Neh. 10.</note> of this <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>iealouſie,</hi> which we haue of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull hearts. As when wee feare the faith and honeſt dealing of men, wee will not truſt to their bare words, but we will haue it vnder their hands and ſeales.</p>
                     <p>The contrary to this feare is <hi>bold venturouſneſſe,</hi> when we ruſh deſperately into all manner of ſinne, and in boldnes of face and hardnes of heart, worke out our owne damnation.</p>
                     <p>Now by this may wee try the truth of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. What, doe we feare to ſinne? when we ſee ſinne following vs doe we runne from it, as the chicken ſeeing the Kite come, flies vnder the wings of the hen.

                     <p n="1">1. Repentance is a <hi>turning</hi> vnto God, and a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning</hi> into our way, out of which we had wandred by our ſinnes. Now the more way and time a man hath loſt, the more earneſt and <hi>zealous</hi> he is in the redemption of both. A man that hath rid out of his way, when once he perceiues it, will ſpurre the harder, and gallop the faſter till he hath recouered ſo farre as he might haue beene if hee had kept his way in a good reaſonable pace. So when the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant</hi> conſiders how much knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hee might haue gained, if the good time which he hath miſpent in his ſins, had beene ſpent vpon better things, when he conſiders how much of his life is paſt in ſin, and knows not how little he hath to come wherin he may walk in obedience he layes the more <hi>zealouſty</hi> about him, that what he wants in <hi>time,</hi> he may redeem with his <hi>zeale.</hi> And this is that which <hi>Peter</hi> vrges, <hi>That henceforward we ſhould liue (as much time as remaines in the body) not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                     <p>And the ſame thing doth <hi>Paul</hi> vrge the <hi>Romanes</hi> withall, <hi>As yee haue giuen your members ſeruants to</hi>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:197:72"/> righteouſneſſe, becauſe hee ſpent ſo much of his time and ſtrength in the ſeruice of iniquity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Before repentance wee are blind, and cannot ſee God, nor the ſweete beauty of his face, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our faces are turned from him, but in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance wee turne our faces to God, and then ſeeing him, his bounty, our crowne and recompence of reward, wee arc ſo rauiſhed and enamoured vpon him, as that with <hi>Paul</hi> in an holy zeale, wee forget that which is behind, <hi>endeuouring our ſelues to that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>which is before, and following hard toward the marke, for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Repentant conſiders the vnconceiuable loue of God towards him in the pardon of his ſins, that howſoeuer hee was running headlong into hell to caſt away himſelfe, and his ſoule, yet the Lord ſtayd him, and was mercifull vnto him in the remiſſion of all his offences. The meditation of which ſweete goodneſſe, and <hi>loue of God conſtraines</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>him</hi> to bee zealous for the glory of ſo gracious a God. This loue of God in Chriſt to him conſtrains him, and inflames and fires his heart with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt zeale to glorifie the Lord. That whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his ſinnes hee had wounded Gods glory, now the loue of God who hath had mercy vppon him in plucking him out of the iawes of Sathan, makes him now zelous of his glory, and carefully to labour to heale theſe wounds which before his ſins had made. This we may ſee in that repenting wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who becauſe <hi>much was forgiuen her, therefore</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luke. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhe loued much,</hi> that is zelouſly. She had not beene ſo zelous before in following her filthy and vnclean
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:197:73"/> loues, as now ſhe was <hi>zelous</hi> in following her holy, and ſpirituall loue.</p>
                     <p>Now this <hi>zeale</hi> in repentance ſhewes it ſelfe in theſe properties.</p>
                     <p>1. Property, It ouerlookes all difficulties, and ouercomes all impediments. <hi>Much water cannot</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Cant. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>quench loue,</hi> nay it kindles rather, and the more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the more loue. Zeale dampes at no bogges, quagmires, hilles, or mountaines, it is an affection that will wing a man, and mount him ouer all. It is not a <hi>Lyon</hi> in the way, no nor yet Legions of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils in the way can coole it's courage. <hi>Michols</hi> ſcoffs was to <hi>Dauids</hi> zeale but as water vpon lyme, made <note place="margin">2. Sam. 6.</note> it the more hotter, <hi>I will be yet more vile.</hi> And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens hatred of the trueth did but encreaſe his <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 126. 127.</note> Loue, <hi>They haue destroyed thy Law, therefore doe I loue it.</hi> A worthy example of repentants <hi>zeale</hi> in this kind was that of that repenting woman, who though Chriſt were at dinner in a Phariſes houſe, <note place="margin">Luke 7.</note> and much company likely there, yet in the holy madnes of her zeale ſhe comes ruſhing in, ſeeking him whom her ſoule loued, not abaſhed with the company, but before them all falls to <hi>kiſsing and waſhing the feete of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Propertie, This <hi>zeale</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> thinkes nothing too good for God, or too deare for him, and ſpares for no coſt and charges in the cauſe of his glory. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> repenting for his numbring of the people, would not haue the place for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and the burnt offrings of <hi>Arannah</hi> for nought, but would giue him money for them. So the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> repenting for their idolatry, ſhewed their <note place="margin">2. Sam. 24.</note>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:197:73" rendition="simple:additions"/> zeale in their coſtly offerings to the Tabernacle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <note place="margin">Exod. 36.</note> till they were faine to be forbidden to offer. So it was with that good woman that poured the box of coſtly oyntment vpon the head of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>3. Property. It makes vs draw others to God. This our Sauiour required of <hi>Peter</hi> as a fruit of his repentance, that <hi>when hee was conuerted hee ſhould strengthen his brethren.</hi> In our ſinnes wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <note place="margin">Luke 22. 32.</note> inſtrumentall for Sathan to draw others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſinnes with vs. True Repentance will make vs zealous to bee as inſtrumentall to bring others to God. <hi>I would,</hi> ſaies <hi>Paul, that not onely thou, but</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 26. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>all heere, were not onely almost, but altogether as I am, except my bonds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Duetie is <hi>Reuenge.</hi> Here is the demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">7. Reuenge.</note> of our zeale for God, and his word when we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge</hi> their quarrells vpon their capitall enemy, the fleſh, the corruption of our nature. There is much deceit in <hi>zeale.</hi> The <hi>zeale</hi> of many is only verball, It may be heard, but not ſeene, but true <hi>zeale</hi> muſt be ſeene as well as heard, <hi>Come</hi> ſaies <hi>Iehu, and ſee what zeale I haue for the Lord.</hi> Now as his <hi>zeale</hi>

This <hi>reuenge</hi> will ſhew what affection we beare to our ſinnes. Before repentance they are ſo deare to vs, that wee cannot endure ſo much as the reproofe of them, but when our repentance comes, then comes <hi>reuenge,</hi> and we can brooke not onely <hi>reproofe</hi> of them <hi>from others,</hi> but <hi>vengeance</hi> alſo vpon them from our ſelues. And
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:197:74"/> when once we can come to be <hi>reuenged</hi> vpon them it is a ſigne wee account them as enemies. For no man deſires <hi>reuenge</hi> but vpon his enemy. <hi>Salomon</hi> knew the right mother of the child by her tender heart, and earning bowells, which could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſee the babe diuided by the ſword, ſurely when wee cannot abide the <hi>ſword of reuenge</hi> to wound and ſlay our ſinnes, wee haue cauſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <note place="margin">1.

                     <p n="3">3. Another ſpecialty in this <hi>Reuenge</hi> is, when with the very ſelfe ſame members and inſtruments of our bodies, which the fleſh moſt of all hath abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſinne, wee in ſpeciall ſort glorifie God. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> that ſinned with his mouth in giuing God <note place="margin">Luc. 1.</note> the lie, repenting, as ſoone as euer he could ſpeake, glorified God with his mouth.

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3. They make their carnall, their bodily, and

                     <p n="5">5. The laſt point of this <hi>reuenge</hi> is, when we vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the fleſh, and caſt it in the teeth with thoſe afflictions which God ſendeth. Though wee may not draw afflictions vpon our ſelues to mortifie the fleſh, yet being impoſed vpon vs by God, we may make our aduantage of them for this vſe, to inſult and triumph ouer the fleſh when God puniſheth it. It argues a <hi>vindictiue</hi> mind in vs, and a <hi>reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> ſpirit, when wee reioyce to ſee another reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelfe vpon our aduerſary. So this is alſo a kinde of <hi>reuenge</hi> vpon the fleſh, when God hauing entred the crucifying nayles into the ſides of olde <hi>Adam,</hi> wee pegge and driue them in further, and hammer them vp to the heads, by imputing them to our fleſh, and charging her with her dulneſſe, and vntowardneſſe, and rating at her as the cauſe of them. Ah thou vile fleſh, I may thanke thee for all this ſmart, I could not turne thee, but I trow God will now tame thee, I trow hee will bring thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thou rebell. Thus if we will helpe God to whip harder, by taking Gods part, iuſtifying him in his dealings, and twittings at our corruptions, we ſhal manifeſt our <hi>ſpight</hi> and <hi>reuenge</hi> againſt this our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. This was notably practiſed by that worthy Martyr <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who when by his cruell aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he was brought to the ſtake to haue his body burnt, and ſo his right hand, yet tooke that aduan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tage againſt his right hand, or rather againſt his fleſh, that had abuſed his right hand to ſubſcribe

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 Initiall repeetance is that at our firſt calling, <note place="margin">1. Initiall.

The meaſure of it, how farre it doth extend. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is in the very firſt beginnings but ſmall, but when once it comes to the birth, it breedes in vs greater ſorrow then is in continued or renued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Initiall repentance then is the greateſt in our ſenſe, and apprehenſion. Indeede ſometimes After-repentance is more bitter by reaſon of the greater fauors and mercies we haue receiued from God, but yet ordinarily the firſt repentance hath a greater meaſure of ſorrow.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt at our firſt repentance our harts are harder then euer after beeing neuer before mollified with any former Repentance, and therefore the harder our hearts are, the harder wedges needes there to cleaue them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Secondly, at our firſt repentance we haue to deale with all the ſinnes of our whole life: now the more ſinnes the more griefe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Thirdly, in our firſt repentance more ſorrow and griefe, becauſe wee neuer yet had any ſenſe of Gods loue before; whereas the former aſſurance of Gods loue in after-repentance, doth ſome thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and ſweeten the bitterneſſe of our ſorrow: theſe bitter pills are ſugred in after-repentance.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 Generally. This life is the time of Repentance while we are in the way, for when our iourney is ended in death, no returning then. <hi>While it is day</hi>

The <hi>Popiſh pennance</hi> is confined within the circle of a few daies, weekes, moneths or yeres, according to the prieſts diſcretion. But the true Repentance of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, is a continuall act, and a daily exerciſe: for the change of the heart is not wrought in vs perfectly at the firſt, but there muſt bee proceeding on by degrees. The <hi>old man</hi> muſt bee <hi>crucified</hi> by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Now <hi>crucifying</hi> is a lingring death. After
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:197:83"/> we are conuerted, ſtill wee carry the body of ſinne about vs, and many infirmities cleaue vnto vs, and breake from vs continually. As therefore in a a leaking ſhip there muſt bee continuall pumping, and in a beggers coat continuall patching, ſo in our liues <hi>continuall</hi> repenting &amp; repairing of our daily breaches. There is matter enough to hold our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance worke all our life long. Many practiſe repentance by ſtarts, now, &amp; then, when the mood and fit comes on them, but it muſt bee a <hi>continuall</hi> practiſe. For</p>
                     <p>1. We haue daily infirmities. 2. Wee had ſin before our birth, euen in our conception, euen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne which will hang vpon vs till our death. 3. After death our ſinnes will remaine in regard of the euill ſent corrupting others. 4. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were our ſinnes before our calling, neuer to be forgotten, but often with bitterneſſe to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred as <hi>Paul</hi> did his perſecution. 5. By neglecting the daily practiſe of Repentance, we ſhall make the practiſe of it farre more difficult afterward. The houſe that is daily ſwept hath but little duſt, and is eaſily ſwept, but if it be ſeldome ſwept then it askes much ſcraping, rubbing, paring and waſhing, the dirt will be growen ſo hard to the floore. So in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of accounts, he that caſts them vp euery day ſhall the eaſier caſt them vp at the weekes end, and he that caſts them vp euery weeke, ſhall the eaſier caſt them vp at the yeeres end, but hee that lets them runne on from day to day, and from weeke to weeke, hee ſhall finde them ſo perplexe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, as that they ſhall trouble his beſt braines
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:197:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> to bring all ends together.</p>
                     <p>The practiſe of this <hi>continued</hi> repenatnce is,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Hearty confeſſion, and bewailing of our ſins to the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Carefull watchfulnes ouer our harts to keepe out all ſinne.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Strict examination of our ſelues at the dayes end, and ſo cenſuring our ſelues, for that we finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, with earneſt calling on GOD for greater Grace.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The third degree is <hi>renued repentance.</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <note place="margin">3. Renued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.

Now here are two things to be conſidered: The practiſe and the times of this Repentance.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The practiſe of this repentance, what it is, <note place="margin">1. The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</note> wherein it conſiſts? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In performing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Repentance, handled before in generall, in a greater meaſure, and a more powerfull manner. Acts 2. Corin. 7. 11. ſpeaking of this <hi>renewed repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> which ſome call extraordinary repentance: <hi>Beholde</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>what care, what cleering,</hi> &amp;c. They had <hi>care</hi> before, but now a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and a more watchfull <hi>care.</hi> 2. In a more ſtrickt <hi>examination</hi> of our ſelues. Examination of our ſelues is to bee practiſed dayly, but now a ſtricter, and ſeuerer, and that ſpecially for our eſtate to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And therefore this narrow ſearch muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer ſome ſecret infirmities before not found out. As in reading ouer our owne workes, or writings the ſecond or third time, wee eſpye that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:197:84"/> which we did not before. So in the ſecond reuiew of our liues by renued repentance we find out more ſinnes then before. 3. In a greater meaſure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and humiliation, as in thoſe <hi>Iſraelites draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buckets of water,</hi> in a greater plenty of teares, deeper ſighes and ſobbes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>times</hi> and occaſions of this <hi>renued repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. The times.</note> They are fiue,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When wee are to performe ſpeciall ſeruices to God, becauſe then wee may feare leaſt our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer negligences may come vp in account againſt vs, therefore we muſt in ſpeciall ſort <hi>renue</hi> our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſo ſeeke vnto God. Thus before the Sacrament of the Lords Supper <hi>Paul</hi> commands a <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 31. Gen. 35. 1. 2. &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>renuing</hi> of our repentance, and a freſh <hi>iudging and condemning our ſelues.</hi> Thus <hi>Iakob renued</hi> his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before he went vp to <hi>Bethell,</hi> and purged his family of the idolls. This God alſo firſt cals for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our approching into his preſence, in the duties of his worſhip, <hi>waſh you, make you cleane,</hi> and then <note place="margin">Iſay. 1. 16. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Come and let vs reaſon together.</hi> So oft then as an holy ſeruice is to bee performed to God, wee muſt <hi>renue</hi> our Repentance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When wee ſeeke for any ſpeciall bleſſing at the hands of God. Becauſe then our ſinnes may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe themſelues, and ſo intercept the bleſſing deſired, then are wee eſpecially to <hi>renue</hi> our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As when our aduerſaries <hi>renue</hi> the battell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, wee are to <hi>renew</hi> our preparation againſt them, ſo muſt we doe heere.

                     <p>HAuing thus abſolued the doctrine of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it will not bee amiſſe to cloſe vp this Treatiſe, with ſome perſwaſiues &amp; <hi>motiues</hi> wherby men may be induced to the practiſe of it. Indeed the bare neceſſity of it might mooue, but ſuch is our dulneſſe, that euen in thoſe things are moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and moſt neerely concerne vs, we are moſt ſupine and ſecure, and neede the goades of the ſtrongeſt argument to pricke vs forward. The <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Two motiues to repentance.</note> then that may perſwade vs are of two ſorts. 1. From the benefits of Repentance. 2. From the euils of impenitency. Out of theſe two heads ſhall ſpring the motiues following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the benefits which come vnto us by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <note place="margin">1. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Which are Exod. 15.</note> Repentance indeed is <hi>bitter,</hi> and many therefore diſtaſte it, as the Iſraelites did the <hi>bitter</hi> waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> But if we ſhall conſider the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that ſhall accrue vnto vs thereby, we ſhall find them as the tree which the Lord ſhewed vnto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> to ſweeten and alay the bitternes therof. Oh ſay ſome, this repentance is an heauy &amp; a troubleſom matter: what good ſhall we get by our mourning &amp; mortification, but depriue our ſelues of our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Repentance is a very hell, or at leſt a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory: well, be it that it be an hell, yet it is ſuch
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:197:86"/> an hell, as muſt bring thee out of hell in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt. <hi>Repent</hi> (ſayth <hi>Iohn) for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen is at hand.</hi> Our way to heauen, is to goe by this hell. And becauſe men aske like thoſe in the Prophet, <hi>What profit ſhall wee haue,</hi> and what <note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> good, if we doe repent, wee will lay downe more particularly the benefits thereof. They therfore conſiſt principally in two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In remoouing of <hi>euill.</hi> 2. In bringing of <hi>Good.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. In regard of the ſting. The <hi>ſting</hi> of ſinne is the guilt of ſinne in the conſcience, binding a man ouer to the wrath of God, and filling the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence full of terrour from the expectation of Gods vengeance. Now the repenting ſinner is freed from this guilt, and from the ſenſe of it in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and hath the free and full remiſſion of all his ſinnes in the blood of Chriſt. <hi>At what time</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Zach. 13. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>ſoeuer a ſinner ſhall repent him of his ſinne, I will blot out all his wickedneſſe out of my remembrance.</hi> The ſame thing teaches <hi>Zachary, In that day</hi> (namely, when (as it is in the former chapter) they ſhall mourne for their ſinnes, as for the loſſe of their firſt borne) <hi>ſhall a fountaine be opened for ſinne and vncleanneſſe.</hi> They whoſe heads are <hi>fountaines of teares</hi> to bathe Chriſts feet in, with <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſhall haue Chriſts heart pierced to be a <hi>fountaine of blood</hi> to bathe their ſouls in, and to waſh away all their guiltineſſe. Theſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:197:86"/> two <hi>fountaines</hi> muſt goe together, and when wee waſh our ſelues in the one, wee ſhall bee bathed in the other. Our <hi>mercy</hi> to our ſinnes breedes Gods <hi>ſeuerity,</hi> as <hi>Ahabs</hi> fooliſh <hi>pity</hi> to <hi>Benhadad</hi> was <hi>cruelty</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. King. 20.</note> to himſelfe; but on the contrary our <hi>ſeuerity</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures Gods <hi>mercy.</hi> Our mercy to our <hi>ſinnes,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents Gods mercy to our <hi>ſelues,</hi> but if wee take <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge</hi> vpon our ſelues in our repentance, then will not God take <hi>reuenge</hi> vpon vs. The promiſes of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion</hi> to <hi>repentance</hi> are very frequent in Scripture. So the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> promiſes pardon to the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <note place="margin">Iſ. 1. 16. 17. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Waſh you, make you cleane, put away the euill of your workes from you,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Repent:</hi> And then followes, <hi>Though your ſinnes were as crimſon, they ſhall be made white as ſnow,</hi> &amp;c. that is to ſay, you ſhall be pardoned and forgiuen. <hi>Haue mercy on mee</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 1. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Dauid) ô Lord,</hi> now what is his argument to mooue God to mercy? <hi>For I know mine iniquities, and my ſin is euer before me. If we acknowledge our ſinnes,</hi> that is, if men repent, <hi>he is faithfull and iuſt to forgiue vs our</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>ſinnes.</hi> Not that <hi>Repentance</hi> merits <hi>remiſsion,</hi> nor that it apprehends it, for ſo onely fath brings remiſſion, but as it is a neceſſary attendant of faith in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending remiſſion. For when wee hold out the hand of faith to receiue Gods mercy, wee doe it as beggers, crying and lamenting our miſeries. And Faith lookes vpon Chriſt with a <hi>weeping</hi> and a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting</hi> eye. And therefore though it bee faith that doth apprehend mercy and pardon, yet becauſe this faith is a <hi>repenting faith,</hi> yea, euen then moſt of all repenting, when it moſt of all apprehends mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, therefore it is that that the promiſe of pardon
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:197:87"/> is made to repentance. Hence <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion</hi> of ſinne are ioyned together by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 47.</note> No Repentance, no Remiſſion. <hi>Except yee</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>repent, yee ſhall all likewiſe periſh:</hi> ſo if Repentance, then Remiſſion. Be it <hi>true</hi> Repentance, though it be neuer ſo <hi>ſmall,</hi> there is Remiſſion, and ſo life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. Hence Repentance is called <hi>Repentance</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 11. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>vnto life.</hi> The <hi>Repenting ſinner</hi> then is in a moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py caſe, for hee hath his ſinnes pardoned, and ſo title to Heauen. So that if a man dies in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he dies in the ſtate of ſaluation, and ſo goes to heauen. For looke what way wee are turned when we dye, thither goe wee, as the tree fals that way wherto it inclined &amp; bowed, when it ſtood on the ground, Now Repentance, as we haue ſeene, is the turning of the heart to God: ſo that if a man die with his face turned to God-ward, to God hee goes. But if he die in his irrepentance, with his face turned from God, to God he can neuer come. Let this then perſwade euery one, as euer hee lookes to be ſaued, to breake off his ſinnes by Repentance. The Papiſts lye when they teach vs, that there are two wayes to Heauen; The way of <hi>innocency,</hi> and the way of <hi>penitency.</hi> No, there is but this one way of <hi>penitency,</hi> by which euen the moſt holy muſt go, for all haue ſinned; and onely the <hi>repenting ſinners</hi> ſhall be ſaued. And againe, here is both exceeding great comfort to the repenting, and terror to the impenitent ſinner. Are thy ſinnes many and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous? If they were as <hi>red as Scarlet,</hi> yet if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent they ſhall bee <hi>made white as ſnow.</hi> It is onely <hi>impenitency</hi> that damnes thee, not murther, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:197:87"/> not inceſt. If thou canſt repent of theſe theſe ſinnes thou art ſafe: when the <hi>ſtreame</hi> of thy ſinnes, and the <hi>ſtreame</hi> of Gods wrath fot thy ſins. come againſt thy ſoule, let the <hi>ſtreame</hi> of that water which iſſued out of Chriſts heart, together with that <hi>ſtreame</hi> which iſſueth out of thy <hi>repenting</hi> eyes meet it, and they ſhall turne away the current of it away from thee. The Phyſician is not ſo much offended with the loathſomneſſe of the diſeaſe, as with the contempt of his phyſick, which he knows being taken would heale the diſeaſe. Nor God ſo much with thy moſt odious ſins, as with this, that thy impenitent heart refuſes his phyſicke. <hi>This is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>the condemnation, that light being come into the world, men loued darkneſſe rather then light.</hi> Not <hi>darkneſſe</hi> ſimply that condemnes, but <hi>obſlinate continuance</hi> in darkneſſe, with loue of it, and delight in it, after that <hi>light</hi> is ſent to helpe vs out of darkneſſe. On the contrary then, if thou repent not, though thy ſinnes were neuer ſo ſmall, they haue waight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to preſſe thee downe to hell. <hi>Impenitencie</hi> makes ſmall ſinnes great and heauy. But Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance makes great ſinnes no ſinnes, in regard of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine imputation. The <hi>greateſt</hi> ſinnes are pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>penitent,</hi> as the <hi>ſmalleſt</hi> vnpardonable to the <hi>impenitent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further, although our ſinnes were pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and forgiuen, yet can we haue no aſſurance that they are ſo, &amp; the promiſes of remiſſion belong to vs; It is preſumption to ſnatch at the <hi>promiſe,</hi> before wee haue the <hi>condition.</hi> And though thou hadſt <hi>pardon,</hi> yet canſt thou haue no <hi>peace</hi> till thou haſt
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:197:88"/> come to God by Repentance. For God holds the ſame rule with vs in forgiuing vs, which hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to vs in the forgiuenes of our brethren. For though our brother come not to vs, and humble himſelfe vnto vs, yet are we bound to forgiue him, but yet wee are not bound to goe to him, to tell him that wee forgiue him, but hee is to <hi>come</hi> and ſay, <hi>It repenteth mee.</hi> Euen ſo deales God with vs, he may happily haue forgiuen vs, yet vnleſſe wee turne and come againe vnto him, and ſay, <hi>It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth vs,</hi> hee will not tell vs, neither ſhall his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">Luc. 17. 4.</note> aſſure and witneſſe it to our hearts, that he hath pardoned vs. Now if there bee <hi>aſſurance</hi> as well as <hi>pardon,</hi> thou ſhalt bee perplexed and turmoiled as much in the want of <hi>aſſurance</hi> as of <hi>pardon.</hi> God often deales with his children, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did with his brethren, hee would not at firſt make himſelfe knowen vnto them, but ſpake roughly vnto them, and threatned them the priſon, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hee telles them, <hi>I am Ioſeph</hi> your brother. So till wee are prepared by Repentance, neither <note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note> will God make himſelfe, nor our pardon knowen vnto vs, but will rather ſpeake roughly, and thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the <hi>priſon</hi> of hell; but if once we come with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 19.</note> and with bleeding hearts vnto him, then can he no more refraine himſelfe, then <hi>Ioſeph</hi> could, but will ſay to our conſciences, <hi>I am your father, Bee of good comfort, your ſinnes are pardoned.</hi> And when we haue by repentance <hi>filled Gods bottle with tears,</hi> then will hee <hi>fill our hearts with this ſoueraigne balme, and</hi> will <hi>annoynt</hi> our hearts with the <hi>oyle</hi> of gladneſſe and the vnſpeakable ioy of the holy Ghoſt. Then
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:197:88"/> ſhall the former feares, ſtings and horrors of the accuſing conſcience be baniſhed, all ſhall be peace and ioy. Repentance charmes the windes and the bluſtring ſtormes of the accuſing conſcience, and makes the hauen of thine heart to bee calme and cleere. So that we may ſay of Repentance, as they of our Sauiour, <hi>What kinde of grace is this, that the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>windes and ſea obey it?</hi> euen the ſea of a helliſh and a raging conſcience. For the experience of all Gods children that haue had any experience of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in themſelues, can witneſſe thus much, that they haue no ſooner ſet themſelues to prayer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and renewing of their couenants with God, but though at firſt they brought an hell in their conſcience, yet they haue preſently felt hell tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into heauen; and in ſteed of the pricke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the vnconceiueble peace of God, cheering and comforting them. It is <hi>Dauids</hi> owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>I ſayd I would confeſſe, and thou forgaueſt mee,</hi> that is, thou tookeſt hell out of my conſcience, and ſhedſt the ſenſe of thy forgiuenes into mine heart. Hence it is that in diuerſe of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> ſpecially the <hi>penitentiall</hi> ones, the Prophet beginning in <note place="margin">Pſal. 6. &amp; 13.</note> much heauineſſe and anguiſh of ſpirit, ends in much ioy and aſſurance. This is the firſt euill which Repentance remooues.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Repentance <hi>remooues</hi> the euill of ſinne in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <note place="margin">2. Of the ſtaine.</note> of the <hi>ſtaine,</hi> the blurre, and ignominy. For euen this alſo it takes away. It ſo heals the wound, that not ſo much as the skarre remaines. When <hi>Oneſimus</hi> had once repented, the ſtaine and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny of his theft was taken away, <hi>Once vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:197:89"/>

The reaſon may bee becauſe they died impenitently, in that their ſinnes and impenitency ſeems to continue the ſinne though the act bee paſt. Hence it is that a man may ſay of <hi>Cain</hi> ſtill, that hee <hi>is</hi> a murtherer, but not of <hi>Dauid</hi> that hee is an adulterer, the ſtaine being waſhed out by repentance, and hee beeing made cleere and cleane as the picked glaſſe. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſay,</hi> ſaies Chriſt to the Phariſies, <hi>you ſee,</hi>

Loe how Repentance was more powerfull to draw downe bleſſings, then murther and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie both together with their vnited forces to bring downe curſes. For this is a certaine rule in all vnlawfull entrances into any Calling, that <hi>After-Repentance</hi> is counteruayleable to a lawfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and both keeps backe the puniſhments due to vnlawfull entrance, and ſometimes brings grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bleſſings of God then a lawfull entrance. Wouldeſt thou then keep backe thoſe plagues thy ſinnes haue deſerued, the way is to repent. Repent of thy ſinne, and God will repent of his plagues. Gods anger is often in Scripture compared to fire, now looke what power the elementary water hath againſt fire to quench it when it is beginning to flame, and burſt out, the ſame vertue is in the water of the teares of Repentance, to keep the fire of Gods wrath from breaking out vpon vs in his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.

Cor. 7.</note> the grace of Repentance in his afflictions, ſo that he can go to God, and confeſſe, and bewayle his ſinnes, calling vpon him for mercy, and renewing his couenant with him, his affliction ſhall not ſo much grieue him, as this his repentance ſhall cheere, and reioyce him. For to ſay the truth, in all our afflictions it is more our ſinne, then the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that pinches vs. Sinne is a thorne in the fleſh which makes but the touch of the finger pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, whereas if that thorne were not, the ſtroake of the whole hand might be endured without any paine. Now repentance takes away that thorne, that is ſinne, and ſo makes our afflictions, both eaſy, and comfortable. None ſo meeke, quiet, patient, ſilent, and cheerefull in affliction, as the Repentant ſinner. The more repentance, the more eaſe in afflictions. Onely the <hi>impaenitent</hi> are <hi>impatient.</hi> He that hath two burdens on his backe at once, muſt needs feele more trouble, then he that hath onely one. Now the impenitent ſinner hath two bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, his affliction, and his ſinne, which addes weight to his affliction, and layes as it were the hand to preſſe it downe vpon vs. But the penitent ſinner hath but one burden, his affliction; as for ſinne, the other burden, his repentance hath eaſed him of it. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> prayes, <hi>Looke on my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and trauell, and forgiue me my ſinne.</hi> Then is <note place="margin">Pſal. 25. 18.</note> our affliction eaſed, when our ſinne is forgiuen, which cannot be without repentance; for it is ſinne onely that exaſperates affliction, and is as ſalt and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:197:93"/> vineger to a ſore; it is ſinne that makes it ſmart. Thus did <hi>Dauids</hi> repentance eaſe, and ſweeten the <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> affliction of his childes death: when by prayer, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and ſuch like exerciſes of Repentance, he had remooued the cauſe of affliction, his ſinne: his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction was not bitter, and burdenſome, but his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance inabled him cheerefully to riſe vp, and refreſh himſelfe. And this is the reaſon why the children of God, as hath been ſhewed, haue alwaies in their afflictions afreſh renewed their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that they might, if not wholy free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from their affliction, yet from the ſtinge and torment of it, and might gaine, if not deliuerance from, yet patience, and comfort in it. for this is the admirable power of Repentance, that it turnes euen croſſes into comforts, loſſes into gaines and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; as contrarily, impaenitent lying in ſinne, turnes comforts into croſſes, and helps into hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances. <hi>Ionah</hi> while he went on impaenitently in his diſobedience, the ſhip could not ſaue him, nor all the skill of the Marriners: but when he once repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then neither the waters could drowne him, nor the heat of the fiſhes maw conſume him. When he was in his ſinne, then the windes, the ſeas, and all were againſt him; when in repentance, all for, and with him: the Sea, and the Whales belly kept him ſafer then any ſhip, the <hi>Nineuites</hi> became obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and humbled themſelues at his preaching. So then afflictions may come, and may abide with vs, but ſhall not conſume vs, no nor yet much diſeaſe vs, if we haue once eaſed our backes of the burdens of our ſinnes by Repentance. This turnes all curſes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:197:94"/> into a bleſſing, <hi>God hath raiſed vp his ſonne Ieſus,</hi> ſaith Peter, <hi>and him he hath ſent</hi> to bleſſe <hi>you in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning euery one of you from your iniquities.</hi> So that <hi>turning</hi> from ſinne is a <hi>bleſsing</hi> that <hi>turnes</hi> all <hi>croſſes</hi> and <hi>curſes</hi> into <hi>bleſsings.</hi> And thus we ſee how Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <hi>remooues</hi> euill both of <hi>ſinne,</hi> and <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. It hath a <hi>preparatory</hi> worke, whereby wee are fitted and prepared to doe that good, which is to be done.

It is neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that with repenting hearts for ſinnes paſt, we goe about the doing of good workes, and ſo draw downe from heauen the grace of God, to enable vs to do that good we go about.

                        <note place="margin">Iſ. 64. 6.</note> This menſtruity muſt bee waſhed away with the teares of Repentance. We bring foorth the fruits of our obedience, as the Beares doe their whelpes, altogether vnſhapen. Wee had neede by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance licke them ouer, and bring them into better forme. And as ſowre apples haue ſugar to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to our taſte; ſo had our obedience neede of the weeping water (ſalt in our feeling, but ſweete to God) to commend it to his palat. Thus did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> cloſe vp his many worthy ſeruices with this act of repentance, acknowledging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an vnprofitable ſeruant, and crauing pardon for his defects: As after his reformation of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes

                     <p n="2">2. Repentance brings alſo <hi>temporall Good,</hi> and outward bleſſings. <hi>If ye conſent, and obey,</hi> that is, if <note place="margin">2. Temporal Good.

And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Lord in threatning other ſins vſes to come in with ſome qualifications vpon hope of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet when he threatens this ſinne, he is <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> in his threatnings, to ſhew that he will be <hi>reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> in his iudgements. <hi>The Lord called to weeping</hi>

Well, but how did the Lord take this, <hi>Surely,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this iniquity,</hi> this iniquity of their horrible impenitency, <hi>ſhall not bee purged from you, till ye die.</hi> Heere is no qualification of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:197:99"/> but God abſolutely threatens that he will neuer pardon this ſin of theirs, that with ſo high an hand, went on in their ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>Secure ſinning and hardneſſe of heart, is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted fore-runner of ſeuere deſtruction. And when God will giue ouer men to his iudgements, he firſt giues them ouer to this iudgement of an impenitent heart.

As on the contrary, when God intends mercy to a nation, he firſt giues them the grace of Repentance. <hi>In that day</hi> (ſaith the Lord by <hi>Zachary) will I ſeeke to destroy all nations that come againſt Ieruſalem, And I will powre</hi>

This is an heauy and a fearefull iudgement to be giuen vp to the hardneſſe of our owne heart. <hi>Dauid</hi> had his choyce of three plagues, whether hee would take, <note place="margin">2.

Thereafter then, as the meanes are to try or diſcouer, ſo is the word of tempting vſed. For firſt, there is a <hi>triall</hi> by a naked offring of obiects or occaſions, thus we ſay of delicate meats, they are
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:197:113"/> temptations. So proſperitie, riches, &amp;c. are temptations. And croſſes alſo Iam. 1. 2. And thus is God ſayd to tempt in Scripture, becauſe in his <note place="margin">How God tempts. Iames 1. 2.</note> prouidence he offers obiects, and ſuch occaſions as will try vs, and when he ſends vs either wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or the contrary, when he ſends vs his Word, the precepts and exhortations thereof. As by ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches caſt out we alſo do trie, and as we ſay, feele one another. So Gen. 22. God tempted <hi>Abraham</hi> in <note place="margin">Gen 22. How Sathan tempts.</note> that commandement of offring vp <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Triall</hi> is by earneſt perſwaſion and ſollicitation to ſinne, for by this meanes we are tried what we are, as <hi>Ioſephs</hi> chaſtity was tried by his miſtreſſes perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And this is the Deuils tempting. Sometime the fiſherman onely ſets his bait without any vrging of the fiſh to come vnto it. Sometimes hauing laid his net, he takes poles, and thruſts, and driues them along into the net. The former way God tempts, but onely this latter Sathan. The meaning heere then is, <hi>that Chriſt was led into the wilderneſſe to bee tempted,</hi> that is, to be perſwaded to euill by Sathan.</p>

It is therefore as if he had more largely ſpoken thus: There was a voice lately heard from heauen confirming thee to be Gods ſonne: This miraculous faſt of thine hath confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſame. Neither ſee I any cauſe to doubt, ſaue that thou art now pinched with hunger, and haſt not reliefe, I would deſire thee therefore both for thine owne, and thy fathers honour, and for his glories ſake, whereof I know thou art zealous, and for this weake bodies ſake, whereunto thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to be mercifull, and not by neglecting it, be guilty of ſelfe-murther, and for my ſake alſo, who would gladly be reſolued, that I may giue thee the honour due vnto the, if it may appeare vnto mee that thou art the ſonne of God.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt. By our former opening of the temptation it appeared that the words of the deuill <note place="margin">The ſinnes whereto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than tempteth Chriſt.</note> ſeemed firſt to vrge Chriſt to the working of the miracle; and then ſecondly, in caſe he did not, to diſtruſt his Fathers voyce. But indeed this latter was the mayne thing he looked at in this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore I ſay Sathan tempted him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt of all to vnbeleefe, not to beleeue his Fathers voyce, <hi>Thou art my Sonne.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to diſtruſt the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, for releeuing his body in this hunger. As in the former he accuſed Gods truth, ſo in this latter his care. As he tempted him to doubt of that particular word ſpoken onely to him, <hi>Thou art my Sonne,</hi> ſo of that generall word ſpoken to all Gods children concerning his prouidence, and protection ouer them. And theſe two were inward, and ſecret ſinnes whereto he tempted, to doubt of the truth of Gods word, and the care of Gods prouidence. And indeed theſe two neceſſarily go together, for we can neuer truſt in Gods prouidence for this life, vnleſſe we beleeue that word of his ſpirit telling vs we are his children. for when we beleeue him to be our father, and our ſelues his children, then will we hange vpon his prouidence, and aſſure our ſelues of his care. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now in the third place out of theſe two bittter roots he would haue drawne him to a third, namely, in this diſtruſt of Gods prouidence to haue
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:197:124"/> wrought a prepoſterous miracle, releeuing himſelfe by vnlawfull meanes.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt then.</p>

                     </label> We ſee it is the deuills chiefe endeauour to call into queſtion the truth of Gods word. God had <note place="margin">It is the diuels chiefe endeuor to call into queſtion the truth of Gods word.</note> ſaid <hi>Thou art my ſonne,</hi> and now he comes with his <hi>If thou be the ſonne of God.</hi> In the word of God there be ſpecially three things. 1. <hi>Commandements,</hi> and theſe he accuſeth as vniuſt and vnreaſonable, <note place="margin">1. commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> as that firſt commandement to our firſt parents. 2. <hi>Threatnings,</hi> and theſe he maketh to be but ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowes, <note place="margin">2. threatnings</note> and meere bugges; as to our firſt parents that threatning, <hi>yee ſhall dye,</hi> no ſayes the deuill, but ye ſhall liue better then euer ye did: So Deut: <note place="margin">Deut: 29. 19.</note> 29. 19. ye ſhall haue peace though ye walke after the ſtubbornnes of your owne heart, neuer feare the curſes threatned. 3. <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and them he <note place="margin">3. promiſes.</note> makes to be but vaine words, as to <hi>Dauid</hi> in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Pſ. 77. <hi>Hath the Lord forgotten to be mercifull,</hi> and <note place="margin">Pſal: 77.</note> to <hi>Cain</hi> Gen. 4. <hi>My ſinne is greater then can be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen: 4.</note> and ſo to all diſpayring perſons. Now in all theſe the deuill aſſaults our faith, not as he thinks without reaſon. For faith in the <hi>commandements</hi> breeds obedience, in the <hi>threatnings</hi> feare, in the <hi>promiſes</hi> comfort. So that by this meanes he would bring it to paſſe, that as God ſhould haue no feare, reuerence, and obedience at our hands, ſo we ſhould haue no comfort at his hands. But yet more <note place="margin">He ſtriketh more ſpecially at our faith in the promiſes.</note> ſpecially doth he ſtrike at our faith in the promiſes, not ſo much at the generall faith in beleeuing the truth of them in generall, as at our ſpeciall iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith applying thoſe promiſes vnto our ſelues.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:197:124"/> Not ſo much to doubt at the generall voice of God in the word, <hi>Euery beleeuer ſhall be ſaued,</hi> but at the particular voyce of God by his ſpirit applying the generall to vs, and ſaying, <hi>Thou beleeueſt, Thou art my ſonne.</hi> For indeede this faith is the ground of all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">Reu. 1.</note> obedience, <hi>The loue of Chriſt,</hi> apprehended by <note place="margin">2.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, faith is the very life of our liues, and the ſtrength of our ſoules, without which we are but very drudges and droiles in this life. <hi>The holy Ghost</hi>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, faith is our cheyceſt weapon, euen our ſhield and buckler to fight againſt him <hi>whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> 1.

Now we know Sathan to be ſuch an one. Hee accuſes God to vs, and then hee goes, and accuſes us to God, as he accuſed both <hi>Iob</hi>

What a ſhame then for Chriſtians to repoſe and ſecure our ſelues in theſe outward meanes? Oh when one hath gotten a great liuing and great friends, we ſay, oh hee is made for euer. God that can breake the ſtaffe of bread, can breake the ſtaffe of friends, riches, fauour, and all ſuch meanes as wee truſt to. As hee did the ſtaffe of phyſicke to <hi>Aſa.</hi> 2. Chron. 15. As he reſtrained <note place="margin">2. Chron. 15. Dan. 3.</note> the fire. Dan. 3. from hurting and from burning, ſo can hee alſo, from helping, and from warming. If wee want meanes then let vs not onely ſeeke to them, but to God. And if wee haue them though in neuer ſuch ſtrength and abundance, yet let vs as earneſtly craue Gods bleſſing and helpe, as wee would doe in our greateſt want. For what haue we when we haue the meanes? Haue wee God locked vp in the meanes? No, we haue but dead things, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to helpe without God.

As he had ouer <hi>Iob</hi> in his vlcers, ouer his children in their death, ouer <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> that was poſſeſſed,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:197:142"/> &amp; ouer that daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Luc. 13. for to this the beſt are ſubiect, yet ſo that Satan is reſtrained &amp; curbed by God, ſo that he cannot do what he would. And this greeuous affliction is ſweetned and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to Gods children, ſo that the more power hee hath ouer their bodies, the leſſe hee ſhall haue ouer their ſoules. Yea, his poſſeſſion of the body is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bee a meanes of his diſpoſſeſſion out of the ſoule. In which regard it is ſayd Numb. 23. 22. 23. <hi>There is no ſorcery againſt Iaakob, nor ſouth-ſaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iſrael,</hi> becauſe God was an <hi>Vnicorne</hi> to take <note place="margin">Num. 23. 22. 23.</note> away the poyſon, and venome, and ſting of it, as he doth of all other afflictions, yea, and of death it ſelfe to his Iſrael.

So that that which Chriſt ſayd of the Diuels inſtruments, <hi>they can kill the body, but not the ſoule,</hi> the ſame may we ſay of Sathan himſelfe concerning his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, He may poſſeſſe the bodies, but the ſoules of Gods children he cannot. Here he had ſome pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer the bleſſed body of our head Ieſus Chriſt, but not the leaſt power ouer his ſoule. In the wicked his ſpecial power is ouer their ſoules. When he was ſent to <hi>Ahab,</hi> he was ſent to go and be a lying ſpirit, &amp; to deceiue him. But when he was ſent to <hi>Iob,</hi> it <note place="margin">1. Reg. 22.</note> it was but to afflict his body with vlcers. Againe, this power which he hath ouer the bodies of Gods children that we now ſpeake of, is ſuch as that they
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:197:143"/> are meerely patients; as in Chriſt in this place. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe for Chriſt to haue gone, and idlely without cauſe to haue endangered himſelfe on the pinnacle had beene to tempt God, But now it is the Diuels ſinne, not his. So in thoſe that are poſſeſſed, all thoſe forced and violent motions, though not onely vaine and idle, but euen horribly ſinnefull, as when hee ſpeakes railingly on God, his truth and his children, theſe are all the Diuels owne ſinnes. And therefore he deſired not to poſſeſſe <hi>Iob,</hi> becauſe his intent was to draw <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe to blaſpheme. But now wicked men, though they are free vſually from this poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue power of Sathan, yet Sathan hath a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power in the voluntary motions of their bodies, ſuch a power as that they ſhall bee agents in that they doe, and guilty of ſinne. Hee carries them not againſt their will, as heere our Sauiour to the top of a pinnacle, nor as him in the Goſpell, into the fire and water, hee offers not that violence to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but he carries them willingly, and driues them as free horſes that neede onely the ſhaking of the hand, to the tauerne, to the ſtewes, to the theater, to this or that euill company. He makes them abuſe their eyes to wantonneſſe, their mouthes to filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and he makes their feete ſwift to ſhed blood. So that as <hi>Paul</hi> beeing guided by the good Spirit of God could ſay, <hi>I liue not, but Chriſt liues in mee.</hi> Gal. <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> 2.

When with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iuſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling we ruſh into any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> or very probable. When God cals vs, then we haue reaſon to expect his helpe according to his promiſe. Examples heereof are firſt in things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, as to ruſh into houſes infected, or poſſeſſed by Satan, to ſet open the doores in the night, to ride thorough doubtfull places, and in dangerous times without weapons, which beſides the tempting of God, is a tempting of man oftentimes. So to runne to the aduerſaries of the truth, and to put our ſelues into the Lyons mouth. Heere certaine heroicall examples of ſome carried by an extraordinary ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are to be excepted. Secondly, in things ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to goe into dangerous places and companies, where we are likely to be corrupted, to goe ſee the maſſe, with <hi>Peter</hi> to goe into <hi>Caiaphas</hi> hall, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with idolaters and prophane perſons, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine prophane companions and ſeruants, to reade Popiſh bookes not being firſt grounded in religion, and without praying vnto God that thou mayſt <hi>not be led into temptation,</hi> reading alſo in filthy play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bookes, and raking in ſuch filthy dung-hils, ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the beeing poyſoned with the ſtench for the hope of finding ſome conceited iewell, in a word, when we caſt our ſelues vpon temptations, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous occaſions of ſinne, that wee might well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough auoyd, wee tempt God. This was <hi>Salomons</hi> ſinne Eccleſ. 2. in following his pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, as if a man ſhould put his finger into the fire,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:197:160" rendition="simple:additions"/> hoping it ſhould not burne. 2. When deſiring any bleſſing of God wee yet refuſe and neglect thoſe <note place="margin">2. When we neglect any good meanes appointed for obtaining any deſired bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> good means by him appointed for the obtaining of it. Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, 1. In things temporall, as if being in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes we ſhould refuſe phyſick, or in pouerty refuſe to work for our liuing, or in any danger we yet ſit ſtil, &amp; hold the hand in the boſome, and ſtirre not, looking that God ſhould worke. Like the fooliſh carter, that when his cart ſtucke faſt cryed to his god, and mooued his lips, but not his hands to help himſelfe. Thus if <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had refuſed the bunch of figges, or <hi>Paul</hi> and his companions to tarry in the ſhip, they had tempted God. True faith as it wil not vſe ſhifts, but in want of meanes make God in ſtead of them, ſo when meanes may be had, will moſt carefully them. As it will not deny God in deifying the meanes, ſo neither will it tempt and mocke God in deſpiſing or neglecting the means, but it wil thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept and imbrace them, as the very hands of God wherby be vſes to work. So that here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe means is as if we ſhould cut off a mans hands, &amp; then pray him to worke. But in the things of this life few there be that neglect meanes, nay here we are too ready and apprehenſiue of the meanes, ſo that we will rather vſe vnlawfull meanes, then none all, &amp; all ſhall be hid vnder this that we will not tempt God, as <hi>Ahaz.</hi> Iſ. 7. 12. Secondly, in things ſpirituall <note place="margin">Iſai. 7. 12.</note> we are more blame-worthy. In temporall matters, where God oftentimes wold haue vs truſt him with out all meanes, there we greedily hunt after means, but in things ſpirituall where God cals vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs to vſe the means for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to ſeek for knowledge
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:197:160"/> as for treaſure, here we are full of faith, and will truſt God without vſe of any means. But this faith, which wil not lay hold on the hands and helps which God affordeth vs for obtaining ſaluationis no faith, but a preſumptuous tempting of God. Men would eſcape the danger of hell, and with <hi>Balaam</hi> ſlothfully wiſh, <hi>O that wee might die the death of the righteous,</hi> but their hands refuſe to worke the works of God. They lie gaping on the bed of idleneſſe, as though in the mean time God would ſnatch them vp into heauen in a charriot. <hi>Peter</hi> tels them that refuſed to walke in the beaten way to heauen, and ſought ſaluation <note place="margin">Acts 15. 10. <hi>Domine Deus ſac me in ijs conſequendis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peram collocare pro quibus obti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendis ſoleo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te crare.</hi>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then will theſe goodly things any more tickle vs, then a iewell, or a pretious ſtone will do a beaſt. This mortification is that which weanes vs from the world, and makes vs to be with <hi>Dauid</hi> Pſal. 131, <note place="margin">Pſal. 131.</note> to be to the world as weaned children to the breſt, who doe not onely not deſire it, but though you ſhew them neuer ſo goodly a breaſt, abounding with neuer ſo luſcious milke, and promiſe them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much, and flatter them what you can, yet
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:197:168"/> you ſhall not get them to take it, and ſuck it. When the diuell entices mortified Chriſtians to ſinne by theſe profers and promiſes of the world, hee is more like to ſpeed, and winne them, then a woman is like to perſwade her weaned childe to doe this or that, by plucking foorth the breaſt. Of all arguments it is the worſt to a weaned childe. Indeed to a ſucking childe it is the onely commanding argument, and ſo is the breſt of the world to an vnweaned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weined and vnmortified Chriſtian. The Diuell hath them on the hip, hee may eaſily bring them to any thing. Looke how a cruſt commands an hungry curre, ſo doth a little worldly traſh a carnall man. They that haue longing deſires, and itching affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions after this worlds delicates, and <hi>they that will be rich fall into temptations and ſnares,</hi> 1.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:197:168"/> plucke out that eie of ours, that is ſo much affected with the beauty of that golden Idoll, and to circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciſe that eare of ours, that is too much delighted with the diuels ſweet muſicke, to put a knife to that throat of ours, that too much longs after his dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Yea, ſo to bee crucified with Chriſt, that our nature may bee quite altered and changed, ſo that now theſe worldly things may no more mooue vs, then hay would doe a Lyon. And indeed if we were thoroughly mortified, nothing would mooue vs then, but the kingdom of God, peace of conſcience, ioy in the holy Ghoſt, encreaſe of grace. And as for the worlds treaſures, wee ſhould deſpiſe them, as growen and graue men doe childrens gewgawes, and bables. And we ſhould take in as fowle ſcorne, to haue the diuell thus offer vs theſe wordly profits, as graue men would take it ill to bee perſwaded to ought by the offers of childrens bables.
